# NLP Visualisation Tutorials

## Introduction

This repository is part of the UCREL Summer School (USS) 2024, showcasing a series of Jupyter notebooks focused on visualising various aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using SpaCy and other tools. These tutorials are designed to help participants understand and apply techniques for text visualisation, including named entity recognition, syntactic dependency parsing, and creating word clouds.

## Installation and Setup

To run these notebooks, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP_Visualisation.git
    cd NLP_Visualisation
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv nlp_env
    source nlp_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `nlp_env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

Open any of the notebooks in Jupyter and run the cells to see the visualisations and understand the various NLP techniques demonstrated. Each notebook contains detailed instructions and explanations to guide you through the process.
