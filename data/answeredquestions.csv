A phased expansion of the routine eligible cohort from people aged 70 years old to those aged 60 years old also began in September 2023, as Shingrix provides a substantially superior and longer duration of protection.</p><p>Uptake is in line with where we expect it to be at this stage. Data from approximately 40% of general practices across England showed that uptake of the first dose of Shingrix in adults turning 65 years old in the first quarter of the programme roll-out was 25.1%. The data also showed that uptake of the first dose of Shingrix in adults turning 70 years old in the same period was 34.2%. This is comparable to uptake of Zostavax in those aged 70 years old in the early part of the programme roll-out, and is anticipated to increase over time.</p><p>Published data is cumulative and there is a time lag because, whilst the data covers all eligible individuals that quarter, individuals whose birthday is at the end of a quarter have far less time to receive the vaccine than those at the beginning and may then be picked up in the next or subsequent quarters. Individuals become eligible when they turn 65 or 70 years old but then remain eligible until aged 80 years old and may not come forward or be called to receive the vaccine immediately. This is accounted for in planning the programme and in relation to vaccine supply.</p><p>With the new vaccine schedule, patients now need two doses of the shingles vaccine. Ensuring patients receive both doses is vital to making sure patients receive the full benefits. To ensure patients come in for their second dose, which is due from six to 12 months following their first dose, NHS England is encouraging local systems to let patients know when and where they will receive their second dose to increase follow-through, send reminders, promote the programme and frame the overall goal in terms of having maximum protection by receiving both doses. A consistent offer and sustained communication to the public is key to achieving uptake of both first and second dose to all those eligible in line with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s advice.</p>","Gorton and Denton","Andrew Gwynne",,"2024-07-23T09:34:34.82Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1721439/answer","Biography information for Andrew Gwynne","http://data.parliament.uk/members/1506","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1721439/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1721439/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2024-07-17","Shingles: Vaccination","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if he make an assessment of the effectiveness of the roll-out of the shingles vaccine.","false","Biography information for Rachael Maskell","http://data.parliament.uk/members/4471","York Central","Rachael Maskell","103"

There is no data available on how much of that funding may have been used for veterans. However, since August 2021, there have been four social prescribing pilots in the areas of Cornwall, Durham, Dorset, and Kensington and Chelsea. Between July 2023 and March 2024, the projects supported a total of 226 veterans.</p><p>In addition to the social prescribing pilots, NHS England has been operating seven Op COMMUNITY pilot sites which provide support to the wider Armed Forces Community, including veterans. These sites are in the integrated care board areas of Humber and North Yorkshire, Hertfordshire and West Essex, Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland, North Central London, Devon, Kent and Medway with Sussex, Bath, North-East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire. Across the seven sites, they have supported 319 referrals relating to veterans.</p><p>No formal single assessment has been made to the potential merits of increasing mental health support to veterans with addictions. It is recognised that some individuals would benefit from mental health support, which is why NHS England commissioned Op COURAGE. This is a bespoke mental health pathway that provides support to veterans with mental health issues and addiction issues. The Op COURAGE service is in addition to the support that is available to veterans from locally commissioned addiction and mental health services.</p>","Lewes","Maria Caulfield",,"2024-05-23T13:02:24.117Z","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1719684/answer","Biography information for Maria Caulfield","http://data.parliament.uk/members/4492","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1719684/answer",,,"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/1719684/answer",,,,,"17","Health and Social Care","Health and Social Care","2024-05-21","Mental Health Services: Veterans","1","House of Commons","To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if she will make an assessment of the potential merits of increasing the level of mental health support provided to veterans who have addictions.","false","Biography information for Steve McCabe","http://data.parliament.uk/members/298","Birmingham, Selly Oak","Steve McCabe","27248"
