            "Original Text: The ‘Children looked after in England including adoptions’  data shows that % of children who were looked after on  March  were placed within  miles of home and % were placed over  miles from home. This data is published on GOV.UK. Information for the remaining % was not known or not recorded. In most cases this will be because the child was an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child but it could also be because the home address was not known or for reasons of confidentiality. Information on reasons why children were placed more than  miles from their home is not held centrally by the department. Sometimes out of area placements are essential to keep a child safe, but the department recognises there are challenges in the children’s social care sector. At the Spring Budget, the government announced a £ million boost to expand places in secure and open residential children’s homes, on top of the £ million secured at Spending Review . This takes the total planned investment to over £ million. This Spring Budget funding is expected to create a further  open children’s homes (OCHs) places and rebuild Atkinson and Swanwick secure children’s homes (SCHs). This is in addition to the  new OCHs, providing  additional placements, and two brand new regional SCHs in London and West Midlands created by the Spending Review funding. This total investment illustrates the department’s commitment to support councils in continuing to deliver high-quality services to vulnerable children and families.\n",

encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (ME\\u002fCFS), which sets out a number of actions to improve the experiences and outcomes for people with the condition through an expansion of research, better education of professionals, improvements in attitudes towards the condition, and improvements to service provision.\\u003c\\u002fp\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eAlongside the publication of the interim Delivery Plan, we ran a public consultation to gather the views and experiences of healthcare professionals, organisations, and individuals with lived experiences of ME\\u002fCFS.

The consideration and analysis of these responses is progressing steadily, and we are on track to publish a summary of the consultation responses shortly.

This data is published on GOV.UK. Information for the remaining 9% was not known or not recorded. In most cases this will be because the child was an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child but it could also be because the home address was not known or for reasons of confidentiality.

This takes the total planned investment to over \\u00a3400 million. This Spring Budget funding is expected to create a further 200 open children\\u2019s homes (OCHs) places and rebuild Atkinson and Swanwick secure children\\u2019s homes (SCHs). This is in addition to the 95 new OCHs, providing 360 additional placements, and two brand new regional SCHs in London and West Midlands created by the Spending Review funding.

Implementation of new tests for existing products can be a complicated process, requiring extensive validation and it is not always possible to replace all of the existing animal tests with in vitro non-animal replacements for each existing authorised product.

The headline statistic Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) charge is the percentage of the loans (both tuition and maintenance) outlaid to students in a given financial year, that the government expects to subsidise, i.e. write-off.

Borrowers earning less than the repayment threshold repay nothing at all, and loans are cancelled at the end of the loan term with no detriment to the borrower. The Student Loans Company will also cancel a borrower\\u2019s liability to repay a loan if the borrower dies or receives an eligible disability-related benefit and because of the disability is permanently unfit for work.

The RAB charge for full-time undergraduate higher education (plan ) loans issued in the \\u002f financial year was forecast to be %. Student loan repayments volumes are sensitive to the wider economic environment.

The VMD assesses applications submitted by the veterinary pharmaceutical industry in line with national and international regulations and guidance to ensure safe and effective veterinary medicines of good quality are marketed. These requirements may therefore necessitate animal testing either to develop and register new veterinary medicines or for routine product quality control, to ensure the continued quality, safety and efficacy batch to batch. Non-animal tests are not always available. The VMD is committed to phasing out the use of animals for testing purposes where possible, in accordance with the principles of 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement). Furthermore, the UK is a signatory to the European Pharmacopoeia (which sets minimum quality standards of medicines) and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. This commitment to the 3Rs is also enshrined in the UK\\u2019s Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act  under which scientific procedures in animals are regulated. For veterinary medicines significant progress in non-animal testing has been made in recent years, including the possibility of replacing animals by in vitro suitable cell cultures in LD50-type testing methods, and the relevant regulatory quality standards and testing requirements have been revised accordingly for these specific medicines. Many Marketing Authorisation Holders for these specific medicines have already, and more recently, introduced these changes to their authorised medicines, which will reduce the number of animals used. Implementation of new tests for existing products can be a complicated process, requiring extensive validation and it is not always possible to replace all of the existing animal tests with in vitro non-animal replacements for each existing authorised product. The relevant UK Competent Authority for regulation of these medicines will continue to monitor the use of animals in these tests and to recommend use of non-animal tests where possible. The Minister of State for Science, Research and Innovation (the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, Andrew Griffith) recently announced that the Government will publish a plan to accelerate the development, validation and uptake of technologies and methods to reduce reliance on the use of animals in science, which will be published in the summer. He also requested that we double our investment in research to achieve these approaches next year to \\u00a3 million across the system in \\u002f.LD50 testing is not required for preclinical development of novel medicines. Quality control testing of some authorised medicines relies on LD50 testing to ensure each batch meets expected quality standards. UK regulators follow the principles of the 3Rs. Significant progress has been made on validating alternative methods which do not use animals, including the possibility of replacing mice by in vitro suitable cell cultures in LD50-type testing methods, and the relevant regulatory quality standards and testing requirements have been revised accordingly for these specific medicines.\",\"The UK Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO) manages the national application process for the UK Foundation Programme, on behalf of the four statutory education bodies for the United Kingdom.

The third National Adaptation Programme (NAP3) was published in July , and addresses the  risks and opportunities identified in the third Climate Change Risk Assessment. NAP3 includes dedicated responses to risks to domestic agricultural productivity and UK food availability, safety and quality from climate change overseas. One of these responses, the recent Precision Breeding Act, is a major step in unlocking growth and innovation in technologies like gene editing and supports Defra\\u2019s efforts to reinforce food security in the face of climate change. Through the Act we want to encourage researchers and commercial breeders to be at the forefront of capturing the potential benefits of precision breeding for British farmers and consumers. For instance, research into wheat that is resilient to climate change is currently underway at the John Innes Centre. Gene editing techniques have been used to identify a key gene in wheat that can be used to introduce traits such as heat resilience whilst maintaining high yield. This could help to increase food production from a crop that . billion people are dependent on globally.

We produce % of all the food we need, and % of food which we can grow or rear in the UK for all or part of the year. UK consumers have access through international trade to food products that cannot be produced here, or at least not on a year-round basis. This supplements domestic production, and also ensures that any disruption from risks such as adverse weather or disease does not affect the UK's overall security of supply. We recognise the impact of climate change on the food system which is why we are investing in the sustainability and resilience of the domestic sector and are undertaking work to the improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change on the wider food system and the resilience of the wider UK food supply chain. The third National Adaptation Programme (NAP3) was published in July , and addresses the  risks and opportunities identified in the third Climate Change Risk Assessment. NAP3 includes dedicated responses to risks to domestic agricultural productivity and UK food availability, safety, and quality from climate change overseas. The Agriculture Act imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to have regard to the need to encourage environmentally sustainable food production. Our farming reforms aim to support a highly productive food producing sector by supporting farmers to manage land in a way that improves food production and is more environmentally sustainable, and by paying farmers to produce public goods such as water quality, biodiversity, animal health and welfare and climate change mitigation, alongside food production. The UK Food Security Report (UKFSR) sets out an analysis of statistical data relating to food security, fulfilling the duty in the Agriculture Act  to present a report on food security to Parliament at least once every three years. It examines trends relevant to food security to present the best available understanding. The report was last published in December  and will next be published by December . Earlier this year, the Prime Minister announced that we will introduce an annual Food Security Index to underpin the three-yearly UK Food Security report.

With this funding we are supporting intelligence-led approaches to interdict and seize drugs as they cross the UK border and prevent criminal groups from bringing drugs to our streets. Across the whole of the UK, the NCA, Border Force, and local police are working in partnership, using intelligence and technology to secure our borders against drug trafficking.

The Government\\u2019s dietary guidelines are based on recommendations from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) and its predecessor, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Nutrition Policy (COMA), and based on comprehensive assessments of the evidence.In its  report, Nutritional aspects of cardiovascular disease, the COMA recommended a reduction in the average contribution of total fat to dietary energy in the population to approximately %, and that trans fats should provide no more than approximately % of dietary energy. In relation to unsaturated fatty acids, the COMA concluded that: monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) had no specific recommendation; for n- polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), there should be no further increase in average intakes, and the proportion of the population consuming in excess of about % energy should not increase; linolenic acid provided at least % of total energy; and alpha linolenic acid provided at least .% total energy. The report also included recommendations on saturated fats, which were updated by the SACN in .A joint SACN and Committee on Toxicity report, Advice on fish consumption: benefits and risks published in , endorsed the recommendation that the population, including pregnant women, should eat at least two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily. Two portions of fish per week, one white and one oily, contains approximately . grams per day of long chain n- PUFA. This recommendation represented an increase in the population\\u2019s average consumption of long chain n- PUFA, from approximately . grams to approximately . grams per day.The SACN\\u2019s  report on saturated fats and health recommended: the dietary reference value for saturated fats remains unchanged, and the population\\u2019s average contribution of saturated fatty acids to total dietary energy be reduced to no more than approximately %, which also applies to adults and children aged five years and older; and that saturated fats are substituted with unsaturated fats, as it was noted that more evidence is available supporting substitution with PUFA than substitution with MUFA.\",\"WorkWell is a pilot programme running in  sites in England.

If a slingshot is carried in a public place with the intention of causing injury it is likely to engage the legislation. The maximum penalty for having an offensive weapon in a public place is  years imprisonment. Where a slingshot is misused as a weapon, and a person is injured, there are a number of offences which may apply, such as causing actual bodily harm, which carry significant sentences.The Criminal Damage Act  creates offences around destroying or damaging property and possessing anything with intent to destroy or damage property. The maximum penalty for offences under the Act is  years imprisonment.Slingshots do however have legitimate uses, for example within competitions and fishing and at present we consider that existing legislation provides the correct balance between protecting the public from the small number of individuals who misuse slingshots, while also allowing the public to enjoy legitimate pastimes.

We are also able to calculate economic activity rates by region using these data.Due to the current smaller sample sizes being achieved by the LFS, recent estimates are showing increased volatility and should be treated with additional caution.

The lack of communication made it difficult to rescue people, who were underneath rubble. Hospitals had collapsed, raising fears that the injured wouldn't be able to receive treatment. There's an urgent need for rescue volunteers, hospitals, emergency health, water purification and telecommunications. At least 27 aftershocks followed. The mass media warn of tsunami, although the Atmospheric Administration rejected it. Eight days later left much of the nation in ruins. Officials estimated the initial earthquake killed about 200,000 people and affected three million. According to the President of Haiti was a total disaster. Nine days after the earthquake the government of Haiti put an end to efforts to find any rescue buried survivors. The announcement came just a day after two people were found alive. It was hoped that removing focus from the rescue operation would allow more money and effort to be diverted to the logistically relief effort. Haiti was facing increasing insecurity from human traffickers and convicts escaped from collapsed prisons. Child trafficking was an other serious issue. The Red Cross and Unicef had started to register orphaned children, and sent some to orphanages for shelter. It's expected that reconstruction could take decades. The remaining forces were rallying as the U.S. military stopped the transport of victims from Haiti because of concerns about the cost of hospitalization. After doctors' calls, the U.S. government resumed its flights for transporting injured despite some objections. The WFP was trying to reduce violence caused by starvation.\",\"Tributes paid to the victims of the July 7 2005 London bombings\\nFour years after the 7\\u002f7 London bombings, when 52 people were killed and about 700 were injured by a series of suicide bombings on transport networks, a 1.4 tonne stainless steel plaque with the names of the victims has been unveiled in Hyde Park. 52 stainless steel columns standing 3.5m tall were also inaugurated. All four suicide bombers were UK residents. Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but police are unsure of its exact role in the attack. Survivors of the bombings launched a campaign for public inquiry, which was rejected by the British government as too expensive and time-consuming. The government's attitude infuriated survivors and relatives of the dead. According to Scotland Yard, the suicide bombers, whose practice shows 'terrorist methodology', had rehearsed their plan nine days earlier. Police were able to trace their movements after recovering tickets and receipts from houses connected to the bombers which indicated the route of their trip. Three years after the attacks, footage of the bombers, taken by a CCTV camera nine days before the bombings, has been shown in court as part of the trials of three suspects alleged to be involved in the preparation of the bombings. Meanwhile, five men, all British nationals, were found guilty for their part in an unsuccessful plot to carry out fertiliser bombings in the UK. As it was revealed, some of them had met with two of the London subway bombers.\",\"In September 2006 it was announced that traffic measures had to be taken in Beijing to control the traffic jam during the Olympic Games. In August 2007, Taipei held \\\"Human Rights Torch Relay Night\\\", in order to protest against human rights violation in China ahead of the Olympics. In September it was announced that the torch of 2008 Olympics will not cross Taiwan due to the political disputes with China. The reciprocal consensus' between China and Taiwan became cracked in many sporting events. On April 5, 2008 the Olympic torch arrived in London. However around 500 people protested against the human rights issues in China and Tibet. During the route, protesters tried to extinguish the torch. The security measures were strongly and around 25 arrests have been made. On April 7, 2008 the torch arrived in Paris, where there were large protests and the torch went out three times. China disapproved the actions by the protesters. On April 9, the Olympic torch arrived to San Francisco. As protesters filled the streets the organizers changed the route of the torch and the authorities made arrests. On August 8, 2008, 90000 spectators witnessed the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games at the National Stadium in Beijing. On August 13, 2008 officials admitted part of Olympics opening ceremony was fake, specifically the young singer\\u0091s voice and some of the fireworks shown on television. The closing ceremony was held on August 24. 204 countries participated and China gathered the most gold medals.\",\"On early December 2007 began the proceedings of the UN conference about climate change in Bali. It was extremely important because the participants should be agreed for a regulatory agreement on greenhouse gas emissions for 2012, given the fact the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. At the beginning of the conference, discussions focused on the developed countries commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years. The EU suggested rapid reduce, but environmentalists were pessimist. Then, delegates from about 190 countries were negotiating a plan for private companies and wealthy nations to pay poorer nations to keep their forest intact. It is called the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries, or REDD proposal. Al Gore expressed the view that the US and China had to make more efforts, in order to protect the environment against global warming. Also Ban Ki-Moon said that countries must find a common ground on climate protection. After almost two weeks of negotiations, the EU threatened, pushing the US, it would not participate in another meeting, if a substantial agreement did not take place in Bali. After the US agreed to the changes proposed by India, the so called Bali Roadmap had been agreed on, to applause from all parties. The Roadmap established the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. This agreement is expected to include the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions, amongst other things.\",\"On January 12, 2010 a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Haiti. Due to the earthquake\\u0092s severity, information was initially confusing, but later the disaster\\u0092s size was obvious. The first assessments were talking about thousands of deaths and millions of homeless people. According to government sources of Haiti, 60 percent of Haiti\\u0092s gross domestic product was lost under the ruins and also, a large number of government officials and police and military forces were among the earthquake casualties. Thousands of dead remained unburied in the streets, and violence and crime were dramatically rose. On January 20, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake had once again struck Haiti, worsening the situation. The US, the UN and other countries said they would provide all necessary assistance to Haiti. After a period of ten days, it was announced that rescue efforts were going to abandon, although international rescue teams pulled out two people alive in the last days. At the end of the month, the US military had halted the evacuation of victims of the Haiti earthquake for medical care, reportedly due to uncertainty about who would pay for the costs, but immediately the US government announced that the evacuations flights would resume. After the earthquake, a major problem in Haiti was a number of alleged abduction of Haitian children for illegal adoption. At the border with the Dominican Republic 10 US missionaries were arrested, accused of child kidnapping. They tried to take 33 Haitian children out the country without the government\\u0092s consent.\",\"In January 2005, Corporal Graner was found guilty of abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison. He pleaded innocent. In July 2005, Maj. Dinenna, former warden of Abu Ghraib, said in his apology that Maj. Gen. Miller, commander of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp recommended using dogs because of their effectiveness in prisoners\\u0092 interrogation. During the hearing Sgt. Cardona and Smith were found guilty of abusing prisoners. In October 2005, the federal judge Hellerstein asked disclosure of more information of the abuses, but the Bush administration denied it for safety reasons. In January 2006, Maj. Gen. Miller declined to testify during the court-martial trial for abuse using dogs, invoking his right against self-incrimination. In February 2006, \\u00abDateline\\u00bb, an Australian TV program broadcast, revealed new photos of the abuse that shows Graner having a leading role in the abuse scandal. A few days later the pentagon confirmed the authenticity of the images. The internet news site Salon published some of their own pictures. The US government expressed concerns about the new abuse pictures being published. In March 2006, the United States stated that the Abu Ghraib prison will be closed. In June 2006, Sgt. Cardona sentenced to 90 days of hard labor. At the same period Human Rights Watch published a report which revealed the extent of torture. Finally, in January 2007 the U.S. army stated that Lt. Col. Jordan will be tried for his involvement in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse case.\",\"An 8.8 earthquake struck Chile in February 2010 killing 214 people and causing significant damages. Strong tsunami was caused at the coast of Chile. French Polynesia, Hawaii and New Zealand were hit by the waves. In March an earthquake struck Chile again, just a while before the country's new president, Pinera, is sworn in. In May, the VI Congress of Mayors and Councilors of the O'Higgins Region takes place in Pichilemu with main topic the regional reconstruction of the region suffered the devastation. During the same period in this region heavy rains were started making life more difficult for the earthquake victims, destroying their temporary accommodation and creating health problems in vulnerable groups. In this difficult situation, a new 5.5 aftershock hits Chile. The day of the National Monuments of Chile, in May, a group of volunteers began the reconstruction of Lolol. Two aftershocks of the magnitude 5.1 and 5.8 were occurred in central Chile in July and October respectively, causing panic in the population for a new tsunami that eventually didn\\u0092t happen. The devastation in the region according to testimonies of the residents was tremendous. Significant monuments of Pichilemu, such as the post office, the Agustin Ross Balcony have been destroyed, while others were severely damaged. The reconstruction of the region set a goal to rebuild the Fishermen Store to stimulate the economy. On April 4, the first monument was erected in memory of the earthquake victims. Finally, in November, 4 aftershocks hit again without any reports of damage.\",\"The 8.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Chile on 27 February 2010 and its subsequent tsunami killed at least 214 people and caused significant structural damage. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had announced that a tsunami warning was in effect for much of the Pacific Rim. According to news agencies \\\"large waves\\\" had already struck a lot of areas. Heavy rains had started through the most of central and southern Chile and had caused serious damages to roads and people. Large aftershocks rocked Chile. Indeed, an aftershock occurred shortly before the country's new president was due to be sworn in. Chileans and artists came to Lolol, a national monument in Chile in order to help repair the damage. Pichilemu was a coastal city which had received strong shocks by the earthquake and tsunami. The giant waves destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street, a coastal city in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, and reached the city's square, destroying everything on their way.  On April 4, the first monument was erected in front of the beach of Pichilemu in memory of the earthquake and tsunami victims. \\n Eight months later, it is going to begin the reconstruction of the region, the boost of tourism and the support of citizens. The Sixth Conference of Mayors and Counsellors of  the O'Higgins Region is going to take place in Pichilemu and it is going to deal  with regional restructuring and ways of managing health problems, education, housing for each municipality.\",\"After 16 days of spectacular sporting competition at the Beijing Olympic Village, the President of the International Olympic Committee declared the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games closed. Host China topped the medals table with 51 golds. USA came second with 36, while Russia finished third with 23. The colourful Closing Ceremony, as well as the Opening Ceremony, was held at the iconic Beijing National Stadium. China wanted everything to be perfect. However, officials have confirmed that at least two parts of the opening ceremony were only a visual effect. The torch relay of 2008 Summer Olympics was subject to large scale protests by groups highlighting the human rights issues in China and the situation in Tibet. Protesters tried to grab and extinguish the torch in London. The Olympic torch went out three times in Paris. The route for the torch was altered and, finally, shortened by nearly half in San Francisco, as protesters filled the streets along the planned route. Taiwan refused China'\\u0092s request on welcoming the torch of 2008 Summer Olympics without Flags, Symbols and the National Song of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Moreover, Epochtimes Taiwan and Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong in China held \\\"Human Rights Torch Relay Night\\\" at Taipei City. This Olympic Torch is first-ever declined by an IOC member without warfare factor and this indicates that the 2008 Summer Olympics has been more faded with politics than previously has occurred. The next Summer Olympic Games will be held in London in 2012.\",\"After the London bombings in July 2005, the British Police searched six houses in Leeds. It was confirmed that the explosives used, came from the building region. At the same time, they announced that all bombers were British citizens and that the surveillance cameras taped them on the day of the bombings near the attacked areas. In order to trace the suspects, two pictures of Hassib Hussain were published and a line was established, so that eye witnesses could testify information related to him. During September 2005, Scotland Yard revealed that the bombers had rehearsed the attacks nine days earlier, according to statements and CCTV tapes. Also, during the same period, the suspect for the attacks Hussain Osman was extradited to the UK by the Italian authorities. On December 2005, the survivors of the attacks participated in the promotion campaign for public inquiry into the terrorist's attacks, trying to push the government to give up the solution of \\u0093narration of events by eye witnesses\\u0094. A year after the attacks, Londoners honored the victims. Officials laid flowers at the location of the explosions and the prime minister made statements. On May 2007 five suspects were found guilty for their part in an unsuccessful plot to carry out bombings in the UK. While a year after, in the trial of the suspects for the attacks of 2005, the jury was shown footage of their moves.

The detainees were taken in Tehran and unofficial information indicated that if they charge them with espionage, the result would be heavy punishment. Britain reacted immediately. \\\"COBRA emergency committee\\\" was activated. Blair expressed his disappointment and he demanded their immediate release. He also stated that he wishes a peaceful solution for the issue. U.S.A and E.U expressed their support and their claim for immediate release. The coordinates of Iranians about the location of the ship wasn\\u0092t true according to Britain and threatened to cease all business deals with Iran. The next days and although originally Iranians stated that they would release the female prisoner, they changed terms due to the hot negotiations. The Iranians, however, stated that the prisoners were in good health and their detention was decent. After 13 days of captivity Ahmadinejad announced that they would be released as a \\\"gift to the British people.\\\" After a ceremony they returned to London. One detainee said that during their captivity they suffered mental stress and that they have admitted the category in order to deter further tensions. Finally, two surveys conducted after a month concluded that the rapture was the result of unfortunate accumulation of factors rather than human mistake.\",\"A week after the earthquake in Southern Asia, the confirmed death count is over 120.000. Indonesia's Aceh province alone counts 80.000 deaths. Sri Lanka announced approximately 28.500, India more than 7.700 and as many as 10.500 foreign citizens are reported missing. As the count continues, a gender imbalance was noticed in deaths by the tsunami, where four times more women than men were killed. This phenomenon is due to the greater physical strength of men and different occupations at the time of the disaster. Because of this phenomenon, many incidents of violence against women have been reported, and it is estimated that they will continue for the time being, therefore the people in charge seek measures to address the problem. The earthquake in Southern Asia was the longest in duration earthquake ever recorded. It lasted between 500 and 600 seconds and released an amount of energy that equals a 100 gigaton bomb, while the gash that was created in the bottom of the sea was measured nearly 800 miles deep. The U.S.A. has committed to offer 350 million dollars to the affected areas, while the U.S. government signed into law on direct tax relief to individuals who have contributed with donations to disaster relief. The amount of donations comes up to 322 million dollars. Japan also offers 500 million dollars.

During this institution, Cancellara won twice in  time trial and had been acclaimed by the audience. Despite the shadow of terrorist attacks, policing was discreet. In the event, Michael Rasmussen had been withdrawn from the Tour by his team Rabobank as he had violated internal regulations of his group. Rasmussen, who kept his overall lead in stage 15 by 2' 23' over the final winner Contador, had lied to the team about his whereabouts in June, saying he was in Mexico while he was, in fact, in Italy. In cycling team, Discovery Channel won. Hincapie led his team and led it to victory. Astana cycling team announced that Vinokourov failed a blood test following his victory in time trial. Tour organizers had asked Astana Cycling Team to leave the race, which had been accepted spontaneously. Vinokourov denied any blood manipulation. The event caused a lot of comments. Two explosive devices were found on a section of the Tour de France bicycle race just outside the Spanish town of Belagua.  There were no reports of injuries but conflicting reports mentioned that the cyclists had passed the area before the devices went off, while others reported that the devices were detonated before the cyclists passed. ETA claimed responsibility for placing the devices on the route.\",\"London Metropolitan Police searched six houses in Leeds in order to find elements about the terrorist attacks on july 7. The raids were dangerous and long lasting. The suspects of the bombings in London are all British nationals. Four of them alleged suicide bombers. The Metropolitan Police released two photographs of one of the London bombers and made a request for any additional information about his whearabouts in order to succeed in arresting him. Another bomb suspect, Hussain Osman, who was accused of planting the failed bomb at the Underground station,  arrived in London and had been arrested following his extradition from Italy. Survivors of the London Bombings set up an online petition calling for an independent Public Inquiry into the attacks.\\n The British government rejected calls for a Public Inquiry. But survivors argue that a comprehensive investigation could teach valuable lessons which may help reduce the likelihood of future attacks, and improve the response capabilities of the emergency services. One year after the terrorist attacks, the Londoners honor the memory of victims. Simultaneously, a video links the attacks with Al-Qaeda.\\nIn 2007, five men were found guilty of plotting to cause an explosion and have been jailed with life sentences.

The Olympic torch that was lit in Greece, travelled all over the world and end up in China, to light the flame during the opening ceremony. During the journey the flame stopped in San Francisco, where it was greeted with protests. Torch of 2008 Summer Olympics won't travel through Taiwan as the citizens cannot welcome the torch with National Song and Flag of the Republic of China. In Paris, the course was interrupted three times by Tibetian activists\\u0092 protesters and posted banners. The Chinese Commission didn't report such plans. The Olympic Games in Beijing began on August 8, 2008, with 2008 percussion instruments, specifically of Confucius, performances and a parade of teams. Later it was revealed that parts of the ceremony were visual effects. Before the start proclaimed that no accesses to any private car near the Olympic venues in Beijing in order not to strengthen even further the already severe traffic problem.

In order to help the earthquake's and tsunami's victims, the world's wealthiest nations poured funding into the damaged region. However, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia chief, Michael Elmquist, warned that logistics of securing the funds, purchasing supplies and shipping them to stricken regions is a long lasting procedure. Meanwhile, the  death toll is increased due to dehydration, disease, and starvation. The offered assistance by the U.S. government was considered limited and prompted complaints. At the same time, the ordinary Americans' donations were touching. The scientists determined that the Sumatra's earthquake was the largest ever recorded. People from around the world raised money for the victims as the Romanians who organised telemarathon and other charitable events. On the other hand, a small Canadian village calls back from the Red Cross  the $ 10,000 which had donated as the election day for approving the donation some council members were absent. The Red Cross has already deposited the cheque, but has indicated it will return the money. Only in Indonesia, the death toll reaches 80000. In southern Asia about 1 million people are homeless and humanitarian agencies estimate that 5 million people need relief. The World Health Organization makes hard efforts to improve the conditions. The vast majority of the victims were women. This fact is justified to some extent but requires protection for the female sex.\",\"Charles Graner was guilty of abusing prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. He was accused of assaulting prisoners for fun. His defense maintained that he was acting under orders to 'soften up' detainees before interrogation. The US commander, Miller, who supervised the detainees\\u2019 detention at  Abu Ghraib declined to testify in the court, by invoking his right to not implicate himself.\\n Colonel Jordan would be tried by a military court for his involvement in the Abu Ghraib abuse case. Jordan would stand trial on eight counts. Human Rights watched claims torture and other abuses against detainees in US custody in Iraq continued and were authorised and routine. The accounts came from interviews conducted by Watch, supplemented by memoranda and sworn statements contained in declassified documents. The Watch proposed appointing bipartisan committee on treatment of detainees. New material showed that soldiers had died because of torture. In the American Civil Liberties Union granted access to unpublished photographs by the court, but the USA appealed the decision. The Pentagon confirmed the authenticity of the SBS's images. Some humiliating images wouldn\\u2019t be displayed. According to the Minister of Foreign the material wasn't disclosed to protect the privacy of prisoners and not cause more violence. Hence the violence at Abu Ghraib, there was Iraqi attacks. Former Sgt Cardona was punished with 90 days of forced labour and demotion for two of the nine categories.

According to Yvo de Boer was important to set an agenda and a date for completion of negotiations on a post-2012 climate change agreement.  They focused on whether the developed countries would commit to reduce greenhouse gases.  European nations were pushing for immediate reductions in carbon emissions but environmental activists weren\\u0092t as optimistic about progress in the negotiations. According to Yvo de Boer, the negotiations' mood  was positive as a working group of delegates had agreed that any future agreement should include ways to encourage countries such as China and India to develop environmentally friendly practices. Japan and the U.S. advocated the voluntary reductions of carbon emissions, while Al Gore called on them to try on global warming. The director of the World Wildlife Fund's Climate Change Program, urged the U.S., Japan and others to act decisively as the global warming is a fact. The U.S and China reacted. Hence this disagreement, the United Nations secretary-general, said that setting greenhouse-gas emission targets may have to wait. A key issue in the negotiations was the plan to reduce emissions from deforestation in developing countries, which was called REDD proposal and was necessary to cover gaps in the Kyoto Protocol. After the U.S agreed to the changes proposed by India, the so called Bali Roadmap had been agreed on and established a time frame and scope for reaching a post-2012 climate change agreement and included targets for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.\",\"The 8.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Chile on 27 February 2010 and its subsequent tsunami killed at least 214 people and caused significant structural damage. The giant waves destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street, a coastal city in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, and reached the city's square, destroying everything on their way. Besides Pichilemu, other cities in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, as Lolol, have suffered significant damages as well. On April 4, the first monument was erected in front of the beach of Pichilemu in memory of the earthquake and tsunami victims. Two weeks earlier, the Mayor of Pichilemu had announced a \\\"tourism revival campaign\\\" whose goal was \\\"to make the city go back to the normality\\\". The reconstruction of Pichilemu began eight months after the catastrophic earthquake. On March 11, Chile was hit by a second earthquake, that reached a magnitude of 6.9, just 21 minutes before the country's new president was due to be sworn in. This time there was no subsequent tsunami and no reports of damage, injuries or deaths. A weaker aftershock was recorded on 5 May. At the same time, heavy rains started through the most of central and southern Chile. The rains affected thousands of people that lost their homes after the main earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Dozens of aftershocks were also recorded in the following months. The strongest earthquakes were measured on 14 July (6.5 magnitude), 21 October (5.8 magnitude) and on 28 November (5.6 magnitude).\",\"Fifteen British Royal Navy personnel was been captured by Iranian authorities at gunpoint in the Persian Gulf off the Iraqi coast. According to Britain, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, was been checked. In accordance with Iran, a British ship was approaching  an Iranian site, which formerly belonged to Iraq. The sailors had been arrested for further investigation. The staff admitted the violation. The sailors would be held until five Iranian guards' had been released, who had been arrested in Iraq.  Britain, supported by the USA and the Europe, required the crew's return and triggered the COBRA. The Iranians had threatened of reprisals if they kidnapped members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The British crew may be accused of being spies and punished exemplarily. Britain had frozen every business arrangement with Iran and had presented evidence that the sailors were in Iraq. Footage of the British crew had been broadcasted on Iranian TV, there a sailor, with a black \\\"head scarf\\\",  admitted that the soldiers were in Iranian waters at the time of their detainment. According to the Iranian Foreign Minister, the female sailor would be released immediately. Britain denied the possibility of release. Iran suspended the release of the British, due to the non-negotiable British stance. On April 4, Iranian President freed the crew. According to Britain the British confessions were extracted under pressure. The crew returned after 13 days of captivity.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330-200 that had departed from Rio de Janeiro en route to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew members, vanished from radar approximately 190 miles off the Brazilian coast. On June 2, the Brazilian Air Force located bodies and wreckage of the missing Airbus, 650 kilometers from the coast of Brazil. There were no survivors. Autopsies from casualties revealed fractures in leg bones, suggesting that the jet may have been torn apart in midair. Air France said that the airplane \\\"crossed through a thunderous zone with strong turbulence\\\" at about 23.00 local time. Shortly before it disappeared, the plane sent 24 error messages indicating an inconsistent speed, that the auto-pilot was not active and a string of systems failures. The inconsistent airspeed data lead suspicion to fall on the pitot-static system. However, the actual cause of the crash could not be determined without the airplane's flight data recorders. Airbus announced that they were willing to fund an extended search for the black boxes. However, Brazilian officials said that it may be hard to find them due to the large depth of the ocean in the area (2,000 or 3,000 meters). Almost a year later, the black boxes have been localized to within about 2 square miles. They are expected to provide information as to what has caused the world's worst aviation disaster since the November 2001 American Airlines Flight 587 crash.\",\"Pictures of extensive detainee abuse in Abu Ghraib were made public in early 2004.

During their testimony, they said they learned the interrogation techniques that included the use of dogs from a team of interrogators that was dispatched to Iraq from Guantanamo military base. On September 2005, a U.S. federal judge ordered the release of additional photos and video relating to the case. The Bush administration claimed that the ordered media could provoke terrorist attacks. Five months later, the Australian TV station SBS showed new photos claiming that some of them document previously unprosecuted abuse. According to a report published on June 2006 by Human Rights Watch, torture and other abuses against detainees in US custody in Iraq continued and were authorized. The Department of Defense denied any Pentagon approval for any abuse. On January 2007, the U.S. Army announced that U.S. Lt. Col. Steven Lee Jordan was going to be tried by a military court. Jordan is the only U.S. officer charged in the Abu Ghraib case.

A strong earthquake (6.1) struck once again Haiti on 20 January, as an international aid effort was underway to help those affected by the previous one. Eleven days after the initial earthquake, the rescue efforts were abandoned and focus was turned to the logistically difficult relief effort. Survivors have been living in makeshift camps. The Haitian president asked for 200,000 tents and 26 million ready-to-eat meals to be airdropped. WFP has provided approximately 2 million meals. Even as aid is flowing into the country, survivors face increasing insecurity from convicts escaped from collapsed prisons and human traffickers. Haitian police arrested ten US missionaries who tried to take 33 Haitian children out the country without permissions. Meanwhile, doctors are struggling to treat thousands of injured with limited resources. Lots of injured were flown to the US for medical care. Overall, the earthquake killed exactly 222.570 people and affected 3 million. The economic loss suffered by Haiti reached 7.754 billion dollars.

Thousands of delegates from more than 180 countries attended the conference. The EU and the vast majority of the participating nations wanted to set a target of a 25-40% cut in GHG emissions by industrialized nations by 2020. Furthermore, the EU warned that they would not attend the major emitters meeting, if no substantial agreement was reached in Bali. On the other hand, the U.S., along with Canada and Japan, refused to agree to any targets at this point. Finally, after two weeks of negotiations, agreement was reached on the so called Bali roadmap. The Roadmap establishes the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. This includes the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for GHG emissions. However, the guideline range of 25-40% for GHG emission cuts by industrialized nations was not included in the final \\\"roadmap\\\", but only in the preamble of the document agreed on only by the members of the Kyoto Protocol.

The lack of communication made it difficult to rescue people, who were underneath rubble. Hospitals had collapsed, raising fears that the injured wouldn't be able to receive treatment. There's an urgent need for rescue volunteers, hospitals, emergency health, water purification and telecommunications. At least  aftershocks followed. The mass media warn of tsunami, although the Atmospheric Administration rejected it. Eight days later left much of the nation in ruins. Officials estimated the initial earthquake killed about , people and affected three million. According to the President of Haiti was a total disaster. Nine days after the earthquake the government of Haiti put an end to efforts to find any rescue buried survivors. The announcement came just a day after two people were found alive. It was hoped that removing focus from the rescue operation would allow more money and effort to be diverted to the logistically relief effort. Haiti was facing increasing insecurity from human traffickers and convicts escaped from collapsed prisons. Child trafficking was an other serious issue. The Red Cross and Unicef had started to register orphaned children, and sent some to orphanages for shelter. It's expected that reconstruction could take decades. The remaining forces were rallying as the U.S. military stopped the transport of victims from Haiti because of concerns about the cost of hospitalization. After doctors' calls, the U.S. government resumed its flights for transporting injured despite some objections. The WFP was trying to reduce violence caused by starvation.\",\"Tributes paid to the victims of the July   London bombings Four years after the \\u002f London bombings, when  people were killed and about  were injured by a series of suicide bombings on transport networks, a . tonne stainless steel plaque with the names of the victims has been unveiled in Hyde Park.  stainless steel columns standing .5m tall were also inaugurated. All four suicide bombers were UK residents. Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but police are unsure of its exact role in the attack. Survivors of the bombings launched a campaign for public inquiry, which was rejected by the British government as too expensive and time-consuming. The government's attitude infuriated survivors and relatives of the dead. According to Scotland Yard, the suicide bombers, whose practice shows 'terrorist methodology', had rehearsed their plan nine days earlier. Police were able to trace their movements after recovering tickets and receipts from houses connected to the bombers which indicated the route of their trip. Three years after the attacks, footage of the bombers, taken by a CCTV camera nine days before the bombings, has been shown in court as part of the trials of three suspects alleged to be involved in the preparation of the bombings. Meanwhile, five men, all British nationals, were found guilty for their part in an unsuccessful plot to carry out fertiliser bombings in the UK. As it was revealed, some of them had met with two of the London subway bombers.\",\"In September  it was announced that traffic measures had to be taken in Beijing to control the traffic jam during the Olympic Games. In August , Taipei held \\\"Human Rights Torch Relay Night\\\", in order to protest against human rights violation in China ahead of the Olympics. In September it was announced that the torch of  Olympics will not cross Taiwan due to the political disputes with China. The reciprocal consensus' between China and Taiwan became cracked in many sporting events. On April ,  the Olympic torch arrived in London. However around  people protested against the human rights issues in China and Tibet. During the route, protesters tried to extinguish the torch. The security measures were strongly and around  arrests have been made. On April ,  the torch arrived in Paris, where there were large protests and the torch went out three times. China disapproved the actions by the protesters. On April , the Olympic torch arrived to San Francisco. As protesters filled the streets the organizers changed the route of the torch and the authorities made arrests. On August , ,  spectators witnessed the Opening Ceremony of the  Olympic Games at the National Stadium in Beijing. On August ,  officials admitted part of Olympics opening ceremony was fake, specifically the young singer\\u0091s voice and some of the fireworks shown on television. The closing ceremony was held on August .  countries participated and China gathered the most gold medals.\",\"On early December  began the proceedings of the UN conference about climate change in Bali. It was extremely important because the participants should be agreed for a regulatory agreement on greenhouse gas emissions for , given the fact the Kyoto Protocol expires in . At the beginning of the conference, discussions focused on the developed countries commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years. The EU suggested rapid reduce, but environmentalists were pessimist. Then, delegates from about  countries were negotiating a plan for private companies and wealthy nations to pay poorer nations to keep their forest intact. It is called the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries, or REDD proposal. Al Gore expressed the view that the US and China had to make more efforts, in order to protect the environment against global warming. Also Ban Ki-Moon said that countries must find a common ground on climate protection. After almost two weeks of negotiations, the EU threatened, pushing the US, it would not participate in another meeting, if a substantial agreement did not take place in Bali. After the US agreed to the changes proposed by India, the so called Bali Roadmap had been agreed on, to applause from all parties. The Roadmap established the target year of  and the scope for a post- climate change agreement.
