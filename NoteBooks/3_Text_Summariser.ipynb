        "Extractive summarization involves selecting key sentences or phrases from the original text and concatenating them to create a summary. The goal is to extract the most important information while maintaining the original context. This method does not generate new sentences but rather identifies and extracts the most relevant parts of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstractive Summarization**:\n",
        "Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, involves generating new sentences that convey the most important information from the original text. This method goes beyond simply extracting key phrases and instead uses techniques like natural language generation to create a coherent and concise summary that may include paraphrasing and restructuring of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Differences**:\n",
        "- **Approach**: Extractive summarization selects and combines existing sentences, while abstractive summarization generates new sentences.\n",
        "- **Output**: Extractive summarization tends to be more faithful to the original text, as it directly uses parts of it, whereas abstractive summarization can be more concise and coherent by generating new text.\n",
        "- **Complexity**: Abstractive summarization is generally more complex and computationally intensive, as it requires understanding and generating natural language, whereas extractive summarization relies on identifying and selecting key parts of the text."

Agreement was reached on the so called Bali roadmap, but opinions differed on the substance of this and other documents that were decided upon.\\n\\nThe Roadmap establishes the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. This agreement is expected to include the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, amongst other things.\\n\\nWhile the EU had wished for the inclusion of a guideline range of 25-40% for GHG emission cuts by industrialized nations by 2020, this had been opposed by the US and others, and so was not included in the final \\\"roadmap\\\" which addresses all nations that are part of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). The range was however included in the preamble of the document agreed on by the members of the Kyoto Protocol.\\n\\nBali Roadmap breakdown\\n\\nThe \\\"Bali Roadmap\\\" document can be seen as having three distinct sections:\\n\\nThe first is the preamble, which is non binding and is there to put the following decisions in context. This is where the guideline emissions cut range would have been. Still included is a reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year.

The February 27 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami completely destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street and its oldest villages. Wikinews has also had access to the original design plans of the new kiosks in Pichilemu, and conducted an interview with merchant Alejandro Mella, known locally as the King of the Cochayuyo (\\\"El Rey del Cochayuyo\\\"), who lost his kiosk after the earthquake.\\n\\nPichilemu is a coastal city in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, known as one of the \\\"best surfing spots\\\" in South America. Its current Mayor is Roberto C\\u00f3rdova Carre\\u00f1o, who was elected internally by the Councillors of the city in September 2009, after several political controversies that ended with three Mayors being displaced.\\n\\nThe territory of Pichilemu has a surface of 7,491 square kilometers, and comprises at least 24 villages, such as Ciruelos, Rode\\u00edllo and Espinillo (the latter two also severely damaged by the March 11 earthquake). Pichilemu is the most popular beach in O'Higgins Region, and many tourists visit it every summer.\\n\\n'The house moved from side to side. I really thought it was going to fall': First earthquake strikes\\n\\nThe earthquake took place in what is considered the \\\"last weekend in the summer;\\\" on Saturday, February 27, 2010 at 03:34 local time (06:34 UTC), while almost all Chileans were sleeping. Hours earlier, on Friday, thousands of people had arrived at Pichilemu. \\\"The house moved from side to side. I really thought it was going to fall. It was 3 or 4 minutes long,\\\" Diego Grez, a Chilean student who was in Pichilemu at the time of the quake, told Wikinews in an interview.\\n\\nA concert was being held at the One Discotheque when the earthquake occurred. It is said that the audience panicked and fled outside the discoth\\u00e8que, and then to the La Cruz Hill. Most tourists fled outside the city right after the earthquake occurred, but many others opted to stay in the La Cruz Hill or the village of Pueblo de Viudas, which are the higher points in the city.\\n\\n\\\"Pichilemu is the symbolic beach resort in the Sixth Region [of O'Higgins], so it was not strange to even think that [during] the last weekend before the entrance to school, many people would be going to take advantage of it to take a vacation; and that's what happened,\\\" reported El Rancag\\u00fcino, the most important newspaper in O'Higgins Region, on February 28.\\nAgust\\u00edn Ross Balcony after the earthquake and tsunami.\\nImage: Diego Grez.\\n\\nThe only radio broadcasting in the area was Entre Olas, directed by Jorge Nasser, which also helped Pichileminians know what happened in other affected places by the earthquake, as they re-broadcasted the audio of Televisi\\u00f3n Nacional de Chile (National Television of Chile). On the day of the earthquake, the station reported that a local police truck had crashed near La Cruz Hill. There was no tsunami warning, and Mayor C\\u00f3rdova was away on holiday when the earthquake struck.\\n\\n\\\"Those who live in Pichilemu, and those who were visiting it, were surprised by the giant waves that annihilated its beach and reached the city's square, destroying everything on their way,\\\" reported El Morrocotudo on February 28. \\\"The most tough thing occurred when the firefighters' alarms sounded twice, and the people in the hill began to yell 'tsunami!',\\\" journalist Tania Arce told the newspaper.\\n\\nThe earthquake destroyed one of Pichilemu's oldest and iconic buildings, the post office, which was demolished in July. The urban centre of Pichilemu was not severely damaged by the earthquake, but its subsequent tsunami caused most of the destruction. The Agust\\u00edn Ross architecture in the city (three of his buildings are National Monuments of Chile) was damaged. Agust\\u00edn Ross Balcony was completely destroyed.\\n\\n'It's something unforgettable to me, I'm proud I saved all of those lives'\\n\\nAccording to SHOA, the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy, the tsunami triggered by the earthquake first reached Pichilemu, at 03:48 (06:48 UTC). A second wave came at 04:15 (07:15 UTC).\\n\\nPoliceman Jos\\u00e9 Ar\\u00e9valo was the only person to warn residents that a tsunami was approaching. Ar\\u00e9valo was patrolling the Las Terrazas beach, when the earthquake occurred. He told El Rancahuaso there were around 25 people in the beach. \\\"Right after the quake, he noticed the sea had shrank around 500 meters inside. He took his megaphone, and shouted people should leave the place instantly.\\\" \\\"The sea is coming out! The sea is coming out!,\\\" he shouted. \\\"The warning was also preceived by nightclubs and pubs surrounding the costanera. Then, the tragedy occurred. The sea destroyed everything on its way,\\\" El Rancahuaso reported. \\\"It all was really quick. Everyone is safe, luckily [..] It's something unforgettable to me, I'm proud I saved all of those lives,\\\" Ar\\u00e9valo added.\\n\\nThe tsunami destroyed restaurants, hotels, kiosks, the Fishermen Store (Caleta de Pescadores), surf schools, the Agust\\u00edn Ross Balcony (located right in front of the Las Terrazas beach) and houses near the costanera (the nearest street to the beach), and flooded the building of the Government of Cardenal Caro Province, the boarding school of Pichilemu, the city square (Arturo Prat Square), and the Supermarket El 9.\\n\\nA local worker, Ricardo Vivanco, also known as \\\"El Gordo\\\" (\\\"The Fat one\\\"), almost was killed by a tsunami, ignoring warnings by the Police and the Fire Bureau. Vivanco was drunk, and went down to the Las Terrazas beach with his friends. The wave washed him away, and was hit on the Agust\\u00edn Ross Balcony's wall. His friends recorded a video and uploaded it to YouTube.\\n\\nDamage in Punta de Lobos and villages\\n\\nIt was reported by Radio Entre Olas on February 27, that the tsunami had provoked massive damage in Punta de Lobos, Pichilemu's most popular beach. The owner of Entre Mar, an hotel and restaurant in that beach, said the tsunami had destroyed all of his buildings there.\\n\\nThe village of Espinillo was badly damaged, and approximately 600 people were made homeless by the earthquake, Teletrece reported on March 16. \\\"We are keeping the government informed, we're also organized with some churches [sic, religious organizations] that are working voluntarily in Espinillo, Los Boldos, Alto Ram\\u00edrez [...] We thank a lot their work, that is not to give them mediaguas [temporary tenements], but something definitive, but I also think they need resources to do it,\\\" Mayor C\\u00f3rdova said.\\n\\n'We are here because we fear about our safety': Residents scramble after second earthquake\\n\\nOn March 11, Chile was hit by a second earthquake, that reached a magnitude of 6.9, and that occurred 40 kilometers southwest of Pichilemu. It occurred at 11:39 local time (14:39 UTC), while the new President Sebasti\\u00e1n Pi\\u00f1era was sworn in.\\n\\nA tsunami warning was issued by SHOA, between Coquimbo and Los Lagos regions. People in Pichilemu fled again to La Cruz Hill. Military authorities assured people in the hill they were going to be safe there, and that it was unlikely a tsunami was going to hit again Chile's coast. The tsunami warning was lifted at 15:50 local time (18:50 UTC).\\n\\nPeople stayed in La Cruz Hill for a longer time than after the previous earthquake, and several activities were made there, such as a concert by Chilean-Brazilian singer Joe Vasconcellos. People were also given food, wood (mostly remains from the destroyed kiosks), and electricity.\\n\\n\\\"We are here because we fear about our safety. We don't want it [a possible tsunami] to catch us. We have to settle down here and to accommodate,\\\" Edith Larra\\u00edn told to Wikinews. Mayor C\\u00f3rdova estimated that at least 2,000 people were staying at La Cruz Hill. Militaries and provincial authorities asked them to leave the hill on March 15, but most refused the deal. People eventually left the hill, due to complaints by the Mayor.\\n\\n\\nEight months on, reconstruction begins\\n\\nOn March 20, in collaboration with the Governor of Cardenal Caro Julio Ibarra, Colonel Ra\\u00fal Melo, and the Mayor of Litueche Bernardo Cornejo, Mayor of Pichilemu Roberto C\\u00f3rdova announced a \\\"tourism revival campaign\\\" of Pichilemu, promoting the surf practice, whose goal was \\\"to make the city go back to the normality.\\\"\\n\\nOn April 4, the first monument was erected in memory of the earthquake and tsunami victims. The monument was created by local artisans, with rocks from several places of the Cardenal Caro Province. \\\"We wanted to create this monument so we don't forget it [the earthquake] [...] This is the beginning of the reconstruction,\\\" said Julio Ibarra. The monument was placed in front of the beach, near the building of the Cardenal Caro Government. Mayor Roberto C\\u00f3rdova said that \\\"it definitely will help us reconstruct [ourselves] espiritually, [and that] is essential.\\\"\\n\\nOn October 20, with the help of the Government, SERCOTEC (Technical Cooperation Service, Servicio de Cooperaci\\u00f3n T\\u00e9cnica) and FOSIS (Solidarity and Social Investment, Fondo de Solidaridad e Inversi\\u00f3n Social), the Fishermen Store (Caleta de Pescadores) began to be reconstructed. Caleta de Pescadores is administered by the Independent Labour Union of Fishermen of Pichilemu (Sindicato de Trabajo Independientes de Pescadores Artesanales), which has twenty-three members.\\n\\n\\\"The Government of President Sebasti\\u00e1n Pi\\u00f1era has been worried about the fishing area, carrying out several actions in help of them, after all that they've suffered after the earthquake and tsunami that hit them [...] This area is working normally again,\\\" Governor Ibarra said.\\n\\nNew kiosks; interview with Alejandro Mella\\nAlejandro Mella.\\nImage: Diego Grez.\\n\\nOn October 6, the Municipality of Pichilemu published the design of kiosks that were going to be constructed, as replacement of those destroyed by the earthquake. As of October 23, four kiosks have been constructed in Pichilemu, specifically on Las Terrazas beach, and two more are being constructed. According to Mauricio Grez, a construction engineer, the construction of one kiosk would cost up to US$ 2,500 (CLP 1,000,000).\\n\\nAlejandro Mella, locally known as \\\"el Rey del Cochayuyo\\\" (\\\"the King of the Cochayuyo\\\"), is a merchant of Pichilemu, who promotes the cochayuyo (durvillaea antarctica), and lost his kiosk after the February earthquake and tsunami. \\\"I was given my [former] kiosk by the Mayor Orlando Cornejo, back in 1993. It was right in front of us [in front of Las Terrazas beach, near \\\"the grotto of the Virgin\\\"], and was made smithereens by the tsunami,\\\" he told Wikinews.\\n\\n\\\"I have always worked on selling cochayuyo here, and the terrain where my kiosk was located before has been disputed by private people, and the municipality approved that. I talked with the Mayor and he said 'I don't know what's going on the beach'; that left me perplexed. [...] I like the new design of the kiosks, they are larger, and we can do more things with it, but they are way too expensive,\\\" he added. Mr. Mella also gave Wikinews a sample of his work as \\\"the King of the Cochayuyo\\\", an essay called \\\"El cochayuyo es una mina repleta de nutrientes y sales minerales\\\" (\\\"Cochayuyo is a mine full of nutrients and mineral salts\\\", pictured below), which he sells for 200 Chilean pesos (0.41 US$), and that contains \\\"tips and information about the plant, and some recipes.\\\"\",\"2008 Olympic Games officially open\\n\\nFriday, August 8, 2008 \\n\\nWitnessed by at least 90,000 spectators, the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games was held at the National Stadium \\u2014 nicknamed \\\"Bird's Nest\\\" \\u2014 in Beijing China this evening.

Many scientists believe the emissions contribute to a rise in global temperatures.\\n\\nYvo de Boer, the United Nations' climate change chief, told reporters Friday that over the past two days, the mood at negotiations has been positive.\\n\\nAsked to provided a concrete example of progress, he said a special working group of delegates has agreed that any future agreement should include ways to encourage countries such as China and India to develop environmentally friendly practices as their industries and economies grow.\\n\\n\\\"So they've gone into an in-depth discussion on mitigation, and have come to the conclusion that really a strong focus needs to be on putting in place incentives for developing countries to mitigate climate change. That came up very strongly. That, to me at least, is a good indication that the mood is good, people are at work,\\\" said de Boer.\\n\\nBut environmentalists have not been as optimistic about progress in this week's negotiations.\\n\\nAlso today the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior arrived in Bali.\\n\\nEarlier this week, Japan took a position similar to the United States in proposing that any new agreement should favor voluntary emissions targets instead of mandatory ones. The two nations believe that binding emissions caps would threaten the economic growth needed to fund technology used to fight global warming.\\n\\nHans Verlome, director of the World Wildlife Fund's Climate Change Program, urged the U.S., Japan and others to take more decisive action in light of a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that found global warming is occurring and is likely caused by humans.\\n\\n\\\"We did not come to Bali to just have another process, and we have two years of talks. It is time to get on with it,\\\" said Verlome. \\\"The IPCC report has delivered the results that are necessary to inform decision making, and the decision making is here, now.\\\"\\n\\nVerlome and other environmentalists say China has taken a leading role in negotiations this week. China wants wealthy countries to help spread technology for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in poor countries.\\n\\nHarlan Watson of the U.S. delegation reaffirmed his country's opposition to mandatory caps on carbon emissions, but said the U.S. would be open and flexible.\\n\\n\\\"The U.S. is committed to advancing negotiations, and developing a Bali roadmap, that will guide negotiations on a new post-2012 global climate change regime that is environmentally effective and economically sustainable,\\\" he said.\\n\\nDelegates are on schedule to begin drafting proposals early next week.

The flight was scheduled to arrive in Paris at 11:10 CET on June 1, 2009.\\n\\nThe Airbus A330-200 was last heard via radio at 22:30 local time (01:30 GMT). The Brazilian Air Force is confirming the disappearance of the aircraft, which vanished from radar approximately 190 miles (306 km) off the Brazilian coast. Reuters reports that an electrical short circuit during turbulence may have caused the plane to plunge into the Atlantic Ocean. The plane with registration F-GZCP has totalled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005. Its last maintenance check was on April 16, 2009.\\nThe intended route of Flight 447.\\n\\n\\\"We have received no news from flight AF447,\\\" said Air France in a statement.

Thousands of people are feared to have been killed by the tremors, which were felt as far away as Venezuela.\\n\\nWitnesses say bodies were lining the streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, after the quake struck on Tuesday afternoon, sending a cloud of dust from falling buildings into the sky. The quake was centered about sixteen kilometers from the capital, and struck at a depth of just ten kilometers, exacerbating the damage. At least 27 aftershocks were also recorded, the strongest of which came in at 5.5 and 5.9 magnitude. A tsunami alert was initially issued following the tremor, but it was retracted shortly afterwards.\\n\\nBuildings across the capital have collapsed, including the presidential palace and the headquarters of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti. However, the president, Ren\\u00e9 Pr\\u00e9val, and his wife reportedly survived the collapse of the building. The country's envoy to the United States believed damage costs could reach billions of dollars.\\n\\nUN peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said many people were in the UN building when it went down and they remain unaccounted for. A Brazilian military official later said four Brazilian soldiers who were part of the UN mission were killed.\\n\\nUN Peacekeeping Chief Alain LeRoy said the organisation is working to learn the fate of its personnel. \\\"As we speak there are still over 100 people unaccounted for under the rubble. We do not know about their fate [...] some people have been extracted out of the building - but only less than 10 for the time being. Some dead, some alive. So we do not know for the time being the fate of the others. But of course, we are extremely, extremely concerned.\\\"\\n\\nThe Notre Dame of the Assumption Cathedral in Port-au-Prince was also destroyed, killing Joseph Serge Miot, the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince.\\n\\n\\\"[...] It would appear that all those who were in the building, including my friend [UN mission head] Hedi Annabi [...] and all those who were with him and around him are dead,\\\" said French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. In a statement released yesterday, the UN remarked that \\\"[f]or the moment, a large number of personnel remain unaccounted for.\\\"\\n\\n'Total chaos'\\n\\nHospitals in Port-au-Prince were reported to have collapsed, raising fears that the injured would not be able to receive treatment easily. \\\"We have reports of some of the most important hospitals in Port-au-Prince have been severely impacted by the earthquake,\\\" said Paul Conneally, the Head of Media for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\\n\\n\\\"I saw dead bodies, people are screaming, they are on the street panicking, people are hurt. There are a lot of wounded, broken heads, broken arms,\\\" recounted Raphaelle Chenet, the administrator of the Mercy and Sharing charity, in a telephone interview with the Wall Street Journal from the Haitian capital.\\n\\nUN officials reported that communications and power are out across the city, making it difficult to get accurate details regarding the full extent of casualties and damage.\\n\\nThe UN also noted that the main prison in Port-au-Prince collapsed, and there were reports of inmates escaping. Spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs, however, said she had no further details about that.\\n\\nEfstathios Daras, the Greek ambassador to Venezuela who also represents Greece in Haiti, described the situation. \\\"We fear major loss of life, maybe in the thousands or tens of thousands. Survivors are using their hands to help get trapped people out. There are fears of big aftershocks which could make the situation even worse. There is huge damage to the infrastructure. We can't get through anymore. All phone lines are down.\\\"\\n\\nJoseph Guyler Delva, a reporter for Reuters, was in the area when the tremors struck. \\\"Everything started shaking, people were screaming, houses started collapsing. It's total chaos.\\\"\\n\\nRachmani Domersant, an employee for Food for the Poor charity described the conditions on Port-au-Prince's streets. \\\"The whole city is in darkness, you have thousands of people sitting in the streets, with nowhere to go. I've seen seven to eight buildings, from office buildings to hotels and shopping stores, collapsed [...] I think hundreds of casualties would be a serious understatement.\\\"\\n\\nPresident Rene Preval told the Miami Herald today that the aftermath of the disaster was \\\"unimaginable\\\". \\\"Parliament has collapsed.

The star indicates the epicentre.\\n\\nThe Red Cross in Geneva says that up to 3 million people have been affected. The international aid agency added that there is an urgent need for search and rescue volunteers as well as field hospitals, emergency health, water purification and telecommunications.\\n\\nThe World Food Program (WFP), which has a large staff on the ground, says the level of destruction indicates many of these people have been affected and will require help. The Director of the WFP office in Geneva, Charles Vincent, remarked that the first priority is to save lives. \\\"To rescue people that are buried, that are trapped, etc. [...] followed very rapidly by a big problem of water, sanitation, epidemic-problems of diseases that might be bred in that kind of situation,\\\" he noted.\\n\\nThe Haitian ambassador to the United States, Raymond Joseph, told CNN the Caribbean nation is seeking US assistance, and called the quake a catastrophe of major proportions. \\\"I'm quite sure we're going to face a disaster of major proportion,\\\" he said.\\n\\nSeparately, the Inter-American Development Bank said it will immediately approve a $200,000 grant for emergency assistance to Haiti. The funds will be used to provide food, water, medicine and temporary shelter for victims of the massive quake.\\n\\nThe US Agency for International Development is dispatching a disaster assistance response team to Haiti and commented that it will continue to provide additional support as needed.\\n\\nThe UN, meanwhile, dispatched approximately 37 search and rescue teams to assist Haitians from a global network. UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon said that US$10 million worth of emergency funds would be used. \\\"I have spoken with Mr. Clinton and we have agreed to mobilize our best assistance and rescue teams and try to reconstruct the Haitian economy. The UN will do whatever possible to help the Haitian people to overcome these difficulties,\\\" Ban stated.\\n\\nBan noted that 3,000 UN peacekeepers were in Haiti, and that they secured the seaport and airport. They are trying to rescue people buried underneath rubble, he said, but were severely hampered by lack of heavy equipment. \\\"Brazilian forces have been working through the night to rescue but because of the darkness and destruction of infrastructure not much progress has been made. We hope it will be better this morning,\\\" Ban said.\\n\\nThe aid group Oxfam added that its emergency response team for Latin America is based in Haiti and is well prepared, with a public health, water and sanitation team in Port-au-Prince. Oxfam says it is preparing to send in emergency supplies as soon as possible from Panama.\\n\\nThe American Red Cross pledged US$500,000 to help the country, and would send out people to assess damage. \\\"As with most earthquakes, we expect to see immediate needs for food, water, temporary shelter, medical services and emotional support,\\\" it said yesterday evening in a statement.\\n\\nA number of other nations, including the UK and Venezuela, are also planning to send aid.\\n\\nA reporter for the Al Jazeera news agency, however, said there might be difficulties delivering aid. \\\"We are about 300km from the epicentre of the earthquake, and we know that the UN agencies and the humanitarian groups here are trying to get together some kind of strategy to get aid over to Haiti. We know that there are trucks loaded with supplies ready to go but the difficulty is that no-one really knows how to get that aid to the people [effectively].\\\"\\n\\nThis quake is said to have been the strongest in Haiti in over two hundred years; the last time an earthquake of comparable magnitude was recorded was in 1770.\\n\\nHaiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country. Recent development efforts have suffered severe setbacks because of political violence, crime, corruption and natural disasters. Seventy percent of the population lives on the equivalent of less than US$2 per day.\",\"Tour de France: One day until 'Le Grand D\\u00e9part'\\n\\nFriday, July 6, 2007\\n\\nLondon is preparing for Le Grand D\\u00e9part of the 2007 Tour de France.

The Tour de France will be in London and the South East for the two days of the 7th and 8th of July. The event will start in Trafalgar Square at 15:00 BST (UTC+1).\\n\\n\\\"I believe this will be the most spectacular Grand D\\u00e9part the Tour has ever seen and the weekend will underline London\\u2019s great sporting reputation,\\\" said Ken Livingstone, mayor of London.\\n\\nThe parts of the Tour that London will be hosting are the Prologue and Stage One.

The Airbus A330 jetliner crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June, killing all 228 people on board.\\n\\nChief executive Thomas Enders said in a statement, \\\"We want to know what happened, as improving air safety is our top priority. We are fully committed to support the extension of the search with a significant contribution.\\\" Although airframers normally supply technical assistance to investigations, the required impartiality makes funding rare, with Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath saying the company's move was unprecedented.\\n\\n\\\"This is an exceptional accident and an exceptional situation,\\\" Schaffrath explained. France's investigative agency BEA has requested financial assistance for the search from both Airbus and Air France. Air France have discussed this possibility with the BEA.\\n\\nInvestigators have already given up looking for the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder using the conventional method of tracing audio 'pingers', the batteries of which would have expired after 30\\u201340 days. Efforts are ongoing using sensitive equipment under tow from a French naval vessel, but if this search proves fruitless then the BEA will seek money for a further three-month search.\\n\\nThe jet's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was able to transmit information regarding problems on board prior to the crash. The ACARS data suggests that the plane had suffered from a loss of valuable readings including airspeed, leading suspicion to fall on the pitot-static system which supplies various measurements.\\n\\nAirbus had already recommended that one component of this system, the pitot tubes, be replaced on A330s. Air France had not done this on the accident airplane although the entire fleet now features the modified design. Three other incidents have been identified since that may involve similar circumstances. The United States National Transportation Safety Board is probing two over American soil while earlier this month another Air France A330 equipped with the new tubes suffered a similar series of problems enroute from Italy to France.\",\"Aid pledges rise; Japan promises 500,000,000 USD\\n\\nSaturday, January 1, 2005\\n\\nIn an abrupt about-face, the world's wealthiest nations have begun pouring funding into the Earthquake\\u002fTsunami damaged region.

The second, by Tony Hall, former BBC Director of News and now Chief Executive of the Royal Opera House, examined the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) handling of the media attention in relation to the incident and has been published on the MOD website. The report by General Fulton is not available to the public, as it is classified because it deals with operational issues.\\n\\nGeneral Fulton identified weaknesses in training, communications and the handling of intelligence and suggested improvements in training for boarding operations.\\n\\nThe Hall report found that the poor judgement in allowing members of the armed forces to talk to the media was not the failure of a single individual, but Defence Secretary Des Browne accepted this as his responsibility, and has apologised for this error. He said that personnel would not be allowed to sell their stories in future.\\n\\nIn a statement to Parliament, Des Browne said that the Ministry of Defence were committed to implementing the recommendations made in the reports and that he expects \\\"the great majority to be implemented by the end of this year\\\".\",\"EU may see no reason to go to next major emitters meeting\\n\\nThursday, December 13, 2007\\n\\nStavros Dimas at a press conference today stated that the European Union would not view it as necessary to attend the major emitters meeting (MEM) if no substantial agreement was reached at the climate change conference in Bali. His statement was made after being asked about rumours of the EU boycotting the US held MEM. He said that he had mentioned the preceding point of view in the presence of an under-secretary of the US government at a business breakfast this morning. He answered to a later question that he felt disappointed at the current stance of the US government, and wished clarity for the moment.\\n\\nAccording to a press release by Greenpeace, the German environmental minister Sigmar Gabriel also declared to the press that the EU would not be taking part in the scheduled MEM in January if substantial progress was not made. Amongst other points that are currently being discussed, one which is often referred to is that of whether or not a guideline frame for emissions reductions is to be included in the preamble of one of the final documents. The proposed frame is 25-40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized nations (known as Annex I nations in UNFCCC parlance), from 1990 baselines. The US is amongst the relatively small number of nations, including Canada and Japan, that are opposed to this.\\n\\nAsked what he knew of the matter at an earlier press conference, Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC stated that Stavros Dimas, the European Commissioner for the Environment, had voiced his opinion that if no agreement is reached now, than there would be no need for the Major Emitting nations meeting to be held, because, so he apparently stated, the MEM is meant to feed into the UN process, and you could not feed something into nothing.\\n\\nThe talks being held in Bali are expected to lead to a roadmap for negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions caps for after 2012, which is when the current first phase of the Kyoto protocol is going to run out. Multiple parties, observers, and the top UN executive of the Climate Change branch all had expressed their hope that this roadmap would also include a target date of 2009 for the conclusion of negotiations. The major emitters meeting is a convention of those nations that have the greatest greenhouse gas emissions, and was held for the first time at the invitation of the US in Autumn this year.\",\"Dec. 2004 Sumatra quake was longest ever recorded\\n\\nThursday, May 19, 2005\\n\\nAccording to new information about the earthquake of December 26, 2004, it was the longest-lasting earthquake ever recorded.\\n\\n\\\"Normally, a small earthquake might last less than a second; a moderate sized earthquake might last a few seconds. This earthquake lasted between 500 and 600 seconds (about 10 minutes),\\\" said Charles Ammon, associate professor of geosciences at Penn State University. \\\"Globally, this earthquake was large enough to basically vibrate the whole planet as much as half an inch, or a centimeter. Everywhere we had instruments, we could see motions,\\\" Ammon continued.\\n\\nThis quake released an amount of energy equal to a 100 gigaton bomb, according to Roger Bilham, professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado. And that power lasted longer than any quake ever recorded. \\u201cNo point on Earth remained undisturbed,\\u201d said Bilham.\\n\\nThe quake was centered in the Indian Ocean, and it created the biggest gash in the Earth's seabed ever observed. It measured nearly 800 miles, about the distance from northern California to southern Canada. Scientists have upgraded the magnitude of the quake from 9.0 to around 9.1-9.3, which is a dramatically more powerful quake.\\n\\n\\\"Two hours after the earthquake has occurred, the wave is spreading out from the Bay of Bengal,\\\" Thorne Lay, professor of earth sciences and director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz said. \\\"Two satellites went over, with the capability of measuring the elevation of the ocean surface. It was just good luck that the passage of the satellites caught the tsunami in motion. There will be more earthquakes of this type, and with more humans exposed to the hazard there will be more devastating losses of life. What we hope to do is develop technologies that can minimize that loss.\\\".\\n\\nFindings reported in the various papers:\\n\\n    * In Sri Lanka, more than 1,600 kilometres from the epicenter, the ground moved nearly 10 centimetres.\\n\\n    * The rupture spread from south to north. Seismometers in Russia recorded the quake at a higher frequency because it was moving toward them, while those in Australia measured a lower frequency as it moved away.\\n\\n    * When the surface waves from the Sumatra quake reached Alaska they triggered a swarm of 14 earthquakes in the Mount Wrangell area.\",\"Romanian artists auction off their works for tsunami victims\\n\\nThursday, January 20, 2005\\n\\nSeveral prominent Romanian artists and celebrities will gather at the Radio Hall in Bucharest on Sunday, January 23, to raise money for the victims of the catastrophic Indian Ocean tsunami of December 26, 2004. In an event titled Romanian Artists in Support of Asia, organised by The Reporter Foundation of Romania, artists will auction off their works, as well as personal objects, with all proceeds being donated to the relief efforts for the tsunami victims.\\n\\nMedia celebrities such as the soprano Felicia Filip and singers Angela Similea and Dida Dragan will also be participating, as well as Maia Morgenstern, known internationally for her role in the film The Passion of the Christ. All ambassadors accredited in Bucharest, as well as political personalities, have been invited to participate.\\n\\nRomanian Artists in Support of Asia is the second major public event organised in Romania to support the victims of the recent Indian Ocean disaster. On Sunday, January 16, the Romanian public raised the equivalent of 395,000 euro in a telethon, while the Romanian Government pledged 150,000 euro for the relief effort.\\n\\nThe artistic event is also part of a campaign by the Bucharest City Hall that seeks to relaunch the image of the Romanian capital as a creative and colourful metropolis. The city will be the first in southeastern Europe to host CowParade, the world's largest public art event, between June and August this year.\",\"7.0 magnitude earthquake strikes off Haitian coast\\n\\nTuesday, January 12, 2010 \\n\\nA 7.0 magnitude earthquake has struck off the coast of Haiti earlier today at 21:53 UTC, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, no tsunami warning was issued, contradicting some media reports that said there was one in place. The quake's magnitude was revised down from an initial report of 7.3 on the Richter scale.\\n\\n\\\"A destructive widespread tsunami threat does not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data,\\\" the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. \\\"However, there is the possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a 100 km [60 miles] from the earthquake epicentre.\\\"\\n\\nThe USGS reports that the epicentre was fifteen kilometres (ten miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince and 1,140 kilometers (708 miles) southeast of Miami, Florida, at a depth of ten kilometres.\\n\\nAccording to USGS analyst Dale Grant, this tremor was \\\"the largest quake recorded in this area\\\"; the last strong quake was in 1984, and had a magnitude of 6.7, he noted.\\n\\n\\\"Everybody is just totally, totally freaked out and shaken. The sky is just gray with dust,\\\" said Henry Bahn, an official with the US Department of Agriculture who was visiting in Haiti and a witness to the incident. \\\"I just held on and bounced across the wall. I just hear a tremendous amount of noise and shouting and screaming in the distance,\\\" he commented, as quoted by the Associated Press.\\nA map indicating the intensity of the earthquake in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, made by USGS\\n\\nAccording to data from the USGS, there were thirteen aftershocks after the initial tremors, the strongest of which was 5.9 on the Richter scale; seven others measured in at 5.0 or higher \\u2013 all the aftershocks were 4.0 or greater.\\n\\nNo deaths have yet been reported, but a hospital in Port-au-Prince was damaged, and a US government official said several houses fell into a ravine. An analyst for USGS in Colorado commented that there could be many deaths from an earthquake of this strength. \\\"I think we are going to see substantial damage and casualties,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe USGS's Mike Blanpied remarked that about three million people were impacted by the earthquake, given its location. \\\"This quake occurred under land as opposed to off-shore, so a lot of people were directly exposed to the shaking coming off that earthquake fault, which was quite shallow,\\\" he said.\\n\\nA lack of communications makes it difficult to ascertain what damage was done. US embassy personnel were \\\"literally in the dark\\\" due to power failures, said State Department spokesman P. J. Crowley. \\\"They reported structures down. They reported a lot of walls down. They did see a number of bodies in the street and on the sidewalk that had been hit by debris. So clearly, there's going to be serious loss of life in this,\\\" he said, as quoted by AP. A reporter for Reuters said he had seen \\\"dozens of dead and injured people\\\" amidst collapsed buildings.\\n\\n\\\"We are trying to get in touch with our people on the ground but we are experiencing communication problems, which is not unusual in a disaster such as this,\\\" said United Nations spokeswoman Stephanie Bunker to Agence France-Presse.\\n\\nAid appeals and international reaction\\n\\nAppeals for aid flooded in following the disaster. In a phone call to CNN, the Haitian ambassador to the US, Raymond Joseph, said: \\\"I'm calling on all friends of Haiti and people who are listening to me to please come to our aid. Today as Haiti is going through the worst day in its history I am calling for all others who got help from us in the beginning to help in support. The only thing I can do now is pray and hope for the best.\\\"\\n\\nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised that her country would also provide assistance to Haitians. \\\"The United States is offering our full assistance to Haiti and to others in the region.

Ahmadinejad met with the detainees shortly after a press conference where he announced that the release will be immediate, and that they will be taken to the airport.\\nCquote1.svg \\tOn the occasion of the birth anniversary of the great prophet of Islam, and on the occasion of Easter and Passover, I would like to announce that the great nation of Iran, while it is entitled to put the British military personnel on trial, has pardoned these 15 sailors and gives their release to the people of Britain as a gift. \\n\\nSpeaking at a press conference that marked the end of Sizdah Bedar, Ahmadinejad said the British soldiers had violated Iranian territory and praised the southwest coast guards for capturing them. He presented their commander, Captain Abol-Ghassem Amangah, with Iran's third degree medal of courage.\\n\\nThe President went on to accuse the British government of not being \\\"brave enough to tell their people the truth\\\" about the incident during the 13 days after their detention. He added that he was \\\"asking Mr Blair to not put these 15 personnel on trial because they admitted they came to Iranian territorial water,\\\", apparently trying to imply that the British servicemen were on a secret mission into Iranian waters, and should not have \\\"confessed\\\" on television to being in Iranian waters.\\n\\nThe British government claims that the confessions were extracted under duress. The United Kingdom has maintained that the captured sailors and marines were in Iraqi territorial waters under a United Nations mandate and has called for them to be released.\\n\\nThe President said that he had issued the order for release on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Prophet Mohammed, Mawlid an-Nabi, and on the occasion of Easter and Passover.\\n\\nIranian media said that the British sailors 'shouted for joy' at the news.\\n\\nThe President said that \\\"[After this meeting] they are free.

The Royal Navy insists that they were operating in Iraqi waters. The Iranian government initially gave the location of the incident as being inside Iraqi waters. After comments from the UK government, Iran gave a revised position for the incident, and the new position provided by the Iranians was outside Iraqi waters and within Iranian territorial waters. The Iranian government then stated that it was not the first time that British ships had entered Iranian waters.\\n\\nThe sailors and marines, from the Type 22 frigate HMS Cornwall, had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection.\\nHMS Cornwall at Zeebrugge in 2006.\\n\\nThe incident occurred near the Shatt al-Arab (Arvandrud) waterway, which forms the southern border between Iran and Iraq. Territorial and navigational control over the waterway has been a constant source of friction between the two countries, helping spark the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Defence said that the Royal Navy personnel had been \\\"engaged in routine boarding operations of merchant shipping in Iraqi territorial waters\\\" and had finished their search of the suspect vessel when they were surrounded by Iranian forces. An Iraqi fisherman (who wished to remain anonymous) said that he saw the incident take place in the Ras al-Beesha area near the northern entrance of the Persian Gulf.\\n\\nThe British government has demanded the return of the servicemen. Margaret Beckett, the U.K.'s Foreign Secretary said, \\\"we sought a full explanation of what happened and left the Iranian authorities in no doubt that we expect immediate and safe return of our service personnel and boats.\\\" The Iranian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office to see the Permanent Secretary to the FCO (as the Foreign Secretary was away from London in her Parliamentary constituency at the time).\\n\\nThe United States also called for the immediate release of the sailors, supporting the United Kingdom's demand. Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the United States Department of State, said \\\"we support the British demand for the safe return of their people and equipment.\\\" The United States also confirmed separately (as reported on the BBC Ten O'Clock News) that it believed the British sailors had been in Iraqi waters.\\n\\n\\\"This is not the first time that British military personnel during the occupation of Iraq have entered illegally into Iran's territorial waters. [The sailors have been] detained by Iran's border authorities for further investigation ... of the blatant aggression into Iranian territorial waters,\\\" said an Iranian foreign Ministry official according to the television station run by Iran's government.\\n\\nIn June 2004, three small vessels and eight Royal Navy personnel were detained by Iranian forces after they allegedly entered Iranian waters on the Shatt al-Arab river without permission. At the time, the story was broken when the capture was announced on state-run Iranian television. British officials only stated that they had \\\"lost contact\\\" with the boats, before confirming their detention.\\n\\nOn that occasion the men were later released unharmed, but only after being paraded blindfolded on Iranian TV and made to apologise for their role in the incident. The equipment was not returned.\\n\\nThe seizure took place on the eve of Saturday's expected vote on a UN Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Iran for refusing to end its uranium enrichment programme.\\n\\nIran recently threatened to seize Coalition military personnel in response to what it claimed was an undercover operation by foreign security agencies to abduct senior officers in its Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Reza Faker, a writer believed to have links with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wrote in the Subhi Sadek (the Revolutionary Guard's weekly newspaper), \\u201cwe\\u2019ve got the ability to capture a nice bunch of blue-eyed blond-haired officers and feed them to our fighting cocks.

Indonesia reports it is no longer counting bodies, but merely struggling to deal with the aftermath and prevent a massive outbreak of typhoid.\\n\\nLocal death tolls\\n\\nNear the epicenter of the earthquakes and tsunami, Indonesia's Aceh province alone may have as many as 80,000 death. Entire villages are gone, with no evidence left of their prior existence. Still, other countries are continuing to report the numbers of dead as best they can:\\n\\n    * Sri Lanka - approximately 28,500\\n    * India - more than 7,700\\n    * More than 300 were killed in Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Somalia, Tanzania and Kenya.\\n\\nAs many as 10,500 foreign nationals are missing in the region, most of them tourists. Sweden has 17 confirmed dead, but more than 2,500 are still missing.\\n\\nReports of death toll\\n\\n    * AP - \\\"confirmed death toll passed 121,000, and 5 million people were homeless.\\\"\\n    * BBC - \\\"at least 124,000 ...

A spokesman for the Red Cross speculated that the toll could increase to over 100,000 as some of the smaller islands in the Indian Ocean are checked, and a U.N. official said that the death toll might eventually approach 80,000 in Indonesia alone.\\n\\nThe immediate fatalities from the earthquake and resulting tsunamis are but a fraction of the total effect from the disaster. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 5 million people lack food, water or basic sanitation necessary for survival. Officials continue to struggle with burying the dead and delivering basic suvival provisions to the population in the coastal and island areas most hit by the disaster.\",\"Tour de France: Yellow jersey Rasmussen withdrawn\\n\\nWednesday, July 25, 2007\\n\\nCurrent yellow jersey, Michael Rasmussen has been withdrawn from the 2007 Tour de France by his team Rabobank for lying to the team about his whereabouts in June, saying he was in Mexico while he was, in fact, in Italy. An Italian Tour de France commentator mentioned he had met Rasmussen in June on a training camp in Italy.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the hotel, where Rabobank's team was staying, was raided and searched late Wednesday by the police. There is no word on whether the search turned up anything.\\n\\nRasmussen had come under heavy fire for having received four warnings from cycling authorities before the race, because of him failing to inform about his whereabouts.\\n\\nBefore today's stage, which he won, Rasmussen said: \\\"I want to make absolutely clear I've had out-of-competition tests prior to the Tour de France, 14 tests during the Tour and all the results are negative ... I do support my team in the fight against doping and [for] a clean sport.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Michael Rasmussen has been sent home for violating the team's internal rules,\\\" said Rabobank spokesman Jacob Bergsma.\\n\\nAccording to Danish news channel TV 2 News, the rest of the Rabobank team will be allowed to finish the race if they wish to do so. TV 2 News also says Rasmussen has left Rabobank's hotel.\\n\\nDavide Cassani, a former Tour de France cyclist and now a TV commentator for Italy, said that he had seen Rasmussen in the Dolomites area of the Alps on both June 13 and 14, 2007. Rasmussen had filed information with his team that he was in Mexico from June 4 through June 26.\",\"Haiti rescue efforts continue, but survivors face increasing insecurity\\n\\nFriday, January 29, 2010 \\n\\nThe survivors from the recent 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti are now facing increasing insecurity from human traffickers and convicts escaped from collapsed prisons, officials have cautioned, even as aid is flowing into the country. The acting head of the UN's Haitian mission, meanwhile, says that that full reconstruction could take several decades. As many as 200,000 people were killed by the tremors, which struck on January 12, and 1.5 million people have been left without homes.\\n\\nAnthony Banbury, the deputy head of the UN mission in the earthquake-ravaged country, commented to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency that survivors queuing for aid sometimes turned violent. He commented that while the aid is vital for the country, \\\"it can be a source of insecurity because it attracts big crowds and there can be disorder around food distribution.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"[It is] absolutely necessary that we get enough food, enough water, enough shelter for the people, and enough security. I don't think any of us are anywhere near being close to being satisfied, because so much more needs to be done,\\\" he added. \\\"[We must] do things smart, as well as fast, and that's a big challenge for us now.\\\"\\n\\nThe Haitian national police chief, Mario Andresol, remarked that electricity blackouts resulted in \\\"bandits [...] taking advantage to harass and rape women and young girls under the tents,\\\" adding that 7,000 inmates of prisons escaped after the quake. \\\"It took us five years to apprehend them. Today they are running wild.\\\"\\n\\nFurther exacerbating the security situation was that the Haitian police force was largely crippled by the disaster, with hundreds of policemen either killed or missing.\\n\\n\\\"At night, people take things. But I don't have a problem. I don't have anything to steal.\\\" said one local resident, Omen Cola, to AFP.\\n\\nChild trafficking, meanwhile, is also an issue; it had been a chronic problem even before the earthquake. The Red Cross has started to register orphaned children, and temporarily sending some to orphanages for shelter, according to a senior advisor for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Bo Viktor Nylund.\\n\\nUNICEF press official Roshan Khadivi told the Xinhua news agency on Wednesday that \\\"we are taking photos and filling in forms to get the children's full details on file. Experience has shown us that there is at least one family member left usually. UNICEF does not believe in institutionalization in orphanages. Children need to be connected with their communities.\\\" Khadivi noted that considering adoption would only be done if the child's parents are not found after several months.\\n\\nSixty orphaned children, meanwhile, were transported earlier by plane to Germany, where they are to be adopted; six of them were hospitalised for fatigue and dehydration.\\n\\n\\\"Starting below zero\\\"; rescue efforts continue\\n\\nEdmond Mulet, the acting head of the UN mission for Haiti, told the BBC that it could take decades to fully reconstruct the country, and any recent development had been negated by the quake. \\\"I think this is going to take many more decades than only ten years, and this is an enormous backwards step in Haiti's development. We will not have to start from zero but from below zero,\\\" he said.\\n\\nMulet, who is also the UN's assistant peacekeeping operations secretary-general, said that the aid logistics were a \\\"nightmare\\\". However, he said he believed the capacity to provide help was improving, saying: \\\"All this is coming together right now. Every day you can see more and more Haitian national police on the ground, working with our troops and more and more water being distributed, so it's a matter of time and putting all these elements together,\\\" as quoted by the BBC.\\n\\nAccording to the head, 200,000 heavy-duty tents had been ordered, to help people cope with the rainy season, which generally starts in May. \\\"Of course, 200,000 family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season - are not available in the market just like that, so they have to be made. It's going to take a few days and weeks before they can arrive, but all this is coming,\\\" Mulet noted.\\n\\nThe Haitian president, Rene Preval, earlier this week asked for 200,000 tents and 26 million ready-to-eat meals to be airdropped.\\n\\nLieutenant Colonel Bruce Ewing, commander of Canada's Disaster Assistance Response Team, meanwhile, was concerned whether there was enough management in relief operations. \\\"Everyone is trying to help, but it's not as coordinated as it should be. We're not getting aid to where it needs to go as effectively as it should be,\\\" he told AFP.\\n\\nEarlier this week, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, described the reconstruction process as being a \\\"colossal work of reconstruction.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In 30 seconds, we lost nearly 60 percent of our gross domestic product, because all of Haiti's resources were concentrated in a small area around our seat of government,\\\" he said. \\\"We have to decentralise. It's the only way to be efficient. It's also the only way to avoid the same problems happening in Haiti again.\\\"\\n\\nThe UN, meanwhile, reports that international funding and aid pledges for the country have now surpassed US$2 billion worth.\",\"Footage of 7\\u002f7 bombers shown to court\\n\\nThursday, May 1, 2008\\nThe scenes after the bombings on July 7\\n\\nA court in the United Kingdom has been shown footage of the bombers that attacked London on July 7, 2005.

A wooden cargo pallet and two buoys had been recovered, but are now believed to have been from a ship. The flight was carrying no wooden pallets. On June 2, it was reported, and previously confirmed by the Brazilian Air Force, that one seat and a life vest were found floating in the water.\\n\\nA fuel slick also thought to be from the plane, has also been confirmed to have come from another source, most likely a ship. The presence of fuel was used as evidence to suggest there had been no fire or explosion on board. Spanish paper El Mundo has quoted an Air Comet pilot flying over the Atlantic at the time as saying he witnessed \\\"an intense burst of white light\\\" falling out of the sky and breaking apart. A bomb threat, which later turned out to be \\\"false\\\", was also reported on a separate Air France flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Paris on May 27, just days before Fight 447 went missing.\\n\\nThe French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) is leading the investigation, and has so far established that there were thunderstorms in the area and a series of automated signals from the plane indicated an inconsistent speed and a string of systems failures.\\n\\nAt 11:10 p.m. the autopilot disengaged and at least one computer switched to an alternative power source. There was an indication that flight control systems had sustained damage, and this was followed by the failure of speed, heading and altitude indicators as well as flight control systems, while control systems for the central computer system and wing spoilers also failed. Four minutes after the problems began the last message indicated total electrical failure and a loss of cabin pressure.\\n\\nFrench armed forces spokesman Christophe Prazuck commented that \\\"Everyone has doubts about everything at the moment and we do not have the slightest beginnings of an answer yet.\\\" French paper Le Monde commented that the aircraft's speed was too low, prompting the BEA to warn against \\\"hasty interpretation or speculation\\\" in regards to the cause. Airbus have reminded all A330 operators of correct operating procedures in extreme weather conditions.\\n\\nFrance has sent the research ship Pourquoi Pas? to the scene and the vessel is currently en route with mini-submarines to assist in searching for and recovering debris. The search is still underway for the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, or black boxes.

The crash is said to be the world's worst aviation disaster since 2001.\",\"VI Congress of Mayors and Councilors of the O'Higgins Region takes place in Pichilemu, Chile\\n\\nSaturday, May 15, 2010 \\n\\nThe VI Congress of Mayors and Councilors of the O'Higgins Region, as part of the program of annual activities of the Chilean Association of Municipalities, is taking place in Pichilemu, Chile.

The photographs show Hassib Hussain who is believed to be bomber of London bus #30. The first photograph is a passport photo of Hasib Hussain and the second shows is a crop of a CCTV image from Luton station at 7:20 on the day of the attack.\\n\\nThe Metropolitan Police claimed in a statement that they believe that the 18 year old traveled from West Yorkshire in the company of three men. He was seen at Luton Station at 07.20 on the morning of the bombings. Police are trying to gain more eyewitness information and have asked the public to call the telephone number: 0800 789321 (+44 800 789321 if outside the UK) if they saw Hussain last Thursday around the Kings Cross area.\\n\\nThe Metropolitan Police made a request for any additional information about Hasib's whearabouts after he left Luton.\\n\\n\\\"We need to establish his movements between 8.26am at King's Cross and 9.47am on the #30 bus when the explosion occurred. Did you see this man at King's Cross? Was he alone or with others? Do you know the route he took from the station? Did you see him get on to a #30 bus?

The aftershock, as reported by the Servicio Sismol\\u00f3gico de la Universidad de Chile (University of Chile Seismological Service), had a magnitude of 5.8, and occurred at a depth of 32.6 kilometers (20.3 miles). It took place at 23:49:56 local time (Thursday 02:49:56 UTC). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said it occurred at a depth of 7 km (4.4 miles).\\n\\nUniversidad de Chile measurements placed the center of the earthquake under the Pacific Ocean, 153 km (96 miles) northwest of the coastal town of Constituci\\u00f3n.\\n\\nDiego Grez, a Wikinews reporter in Pichilemu, said, \\\"It occurred very suddenly, and I felt the earth was moving like in circles.\\\" The coastal city of Pichilemu is about 150 km (about 90 miles) from the center of Wednesday night's earthquake.\\n\\nThe USGS reported it occurred off the coast of the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region coast, 206 km (128 miles) west-northwest of Talca; 244 kilometers (151 miles) north-northwest of Concepci\\u00f3n; 263 km (164 miles) southwest of Valpara\\u00edso; and 313 km (195 miles) west-southwest of Santiago, the capital of the country.\\n\\nAs reported by ONEMI, Chile's National Emergencies Office, the aftershock was felt throughout the Valpara\\u00edso (Mercalli III), Santiago Metropolitan (II, III, IV), O'Higgins (IV), Maule (III, IV, V), B\\u00edo B\\u00edo (II, III, IV) and La Araucan\\u00eda regions (II, III), including cities such as Santiago, Vi\\u00f1a del Mar, Lolol, Santa Cruz, Curic\\u00f3, Cauquenes, Chill\\u00e1n, and Temuco. No damage or casualties were reported, and there was no disturbance to utilities.\\n\\nGrez said of Wednesday's midnight tremor, \\\"I could see my sister coming down from the second floor of my house, she was very frightened. There are some small bells in the entrance of my house, and they were sounding very loud. It was terrifying, I just couldn't move.\\\"\\n\\nThere were at least five following aftershocks, according to La Naci\\u00f3n. The strongest one, a magnitude 4.1, occurred on land, at 06:44 local time (09:44 UTC); it was centered 66 km (41 miles) southeast of Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region and was felt stronger in Talca. A further aftershock, of magnitude 2.6, occurred 15 km (9.3 mi) southwest of Pichilemu, at 02:41 local time (05:41 UTC).\",\"London bomb survivors launch campaign for public inquiry\\n\\nSunday, December 18, 2005\\n\\nSurvivors of the London Bombings have urged the British public to write to their MPs, and set up an online petition calling for an independent Public Inquiry into the attacks.\\n\\n52 people were killed and hundreds more injured on July 7th 2005 when four suicide bombers blew themselves up on three separate London Underground trains and a public bus.\\n\\nEarlier this week the British government rejected calls for a Public Inquiry, arguing that such an investigation would be too expensive, take too long, and be a distraction from their efforts to combat terrorism. Instead, the government has offered to put together a \\\"narrative of events\\\".\\n\\nBut survivors of the attack argue that a fully comprehensive investigation could teach valuable lessons which may help reduce the likelihood of future attacks, and improve the response capabilities of the emergency services.\\n\\nSome survivors, such as Rachel North (a pseudonym), who has been active in organising a support group for her fellow victims, have been angered by the government's alternative proposal of a \\\"narrative\\\". Writing on the weblog she started to help her, and others, come to terms with the aftermath of July 7th, Ms North says:\\n\\n\\\"Even if you don't like the questions, don't like the answers, think you know the answers already, Mr Blair, it is us, not you, who are paying the cost for this... If the cost of answering questions makes you squirm, then too bad... We run the risks on the trains, the buses, the streets each day... How dare you presume you know our questions and how dare you presume that they can be answered by a 'narrative of what happened', as if we are children to be placated with a story. I know what happened, I want to know why.\\\"\\n\\nMs North also quotes a number of other survivors:\\n\\n\\\"We are constantly reminded that this is the worst peace time bombing London has ever seen, for something that bad there should be an inquiry. People died, families lost someone they loved and hundreds are still suffering. You can't put a price on that but apparently the government can.\\\" - \\\"Fiona\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If nothing else, an enquiry would make sure some of these lessons were learnt in case, God forbid, anything like this happened again. I thought there were plansin place for emergencies such as this. Whilst the emergency services did a fantastic job on the day, I have been stunningly underwhelmed by the support offered to victims since.\\\" - \\\"Pauline\\\"\\n\\nAn anonymous survivor, writing on the \\\"Yorkshire lass\\\" website, says:\\n\\n\\\"'When I watched the Al-Qaeda video declaring Jihad against the UK I was haunted by the familiarity of the voice, it was my voice, my accent, my dialect. This is not a man who was recruited and trained in some far off country that I have barely heard of, this was a man who was recruited and trained while he lived 20 minutes from my mother's home where I was born and raised.The words he spoke of are words similar to what I have heard many times from disillusioned young men that I studied for my A Levels with. They are the words of hatred I overheard when I worked as a support worker at my local college. They were words of students who were educated... when someone follows through with the actions of those opinions to the detriment of others, questions need to be asked why preventions were not put in place and this needs to be done by public inquiry for peace of mind.I have been told that I am looking for justice in the wrong place and in some way that is right. However, I want some sort of justice, some manner of peace of mind, some questions answered and resolutions made. I don't want others to have to go through what myself and hundreds of other commuters did on that Summer's day.'\\\"\\n\\nRelatives of the dead have also been very critical. Quoted on the BBC's website, Saba Mozakka, the daughter of Behnaz Mozakka,who died in the Piccadilly Line explosion, said:\\n\\n\\\"The families will be campaigning for there to be a full public inquiry... A narrative of events will not satisfy anybody. This is not something we will go away on.\\\"\\n\\nMarie Fatayi-Williams, whose son Anthony was killed in the attack, told the BBC: \\\"I ask myself - if there is really nothing to hide then why shy away from a public inquiry? It is the only real way that we can truly get things discussed and see for ourselves what happened and what lessons can be learnt and whether we are better prepared now than on 7 July... I have a son who was killed and is never going to come back. Nobody is going to tell me that [an inquiry] is a waste of police time.\\\"\\n\\nThe survivors' petition has so far gathered over 100 signatures. The British government has given no response as yet.\",\"Black boxes from Air France Flight 447 localized\\n\\nThursday, May 6, 2010 \\n\\nAir France A330-200 F-GZCP lands at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport on March 28, 2007. The aircraft was destroyed in Air France Flight 447 when the plane hit and crashed in the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 228 people on board.\\n\\nThe flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, or \\\"black boxes\\\" from an Air France plane that crashed on June 1 last year in the Atlantic Ocean, have been localized to within about 2 square miles (5 square kilometers), a French official said on Thursday.\\n\\nThe French government and military officials have urged caution, saying there is no guarantee the flight recorders will be found. French navy spokesman Hugues du Plessis d'Argentre commented to AFP, \\\"[I]t's like trying to find a shoe box in an area the size of Paris, at a depth of 3,000m (9,800ft) and in a terrain as rugged as the Alps.\\\"\\n\\nThe aircraft, an Airbus A330-200, carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew members, for a total of 228 people on board, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean after flying in bad weather. The pitot tubes, which measure airspeed, are considered likely to have been a contributing factor to the crash. However, the actual cause has yet to be determined.\\n\\nThe search is now in its third phase, which started on March 30 \\u2013 April 1, 2010 and was originally announced to last 30 days. However, on May 4, the search was extended to May 25.\",\"Americans contribute to relief effort\\n\\nFriday, December 31, 2004\\n\\nWhile complaints about the 'miserly' generosity of the Bush Administration have surfaced in recent days, donations and actions at the grassroots level have quietly illustrated the concern and sympathy felt by ordinary Americans.\\n\\nOn Monday of this week, Jan Egeland, the UN's chief of emergency relief said that rich nations like the U.S. were being \\\"stingy\\\" by making small contributions. Egeland later recanted his statement, adding that America's contributions to Asia's tsunami relief was \\\"one of the most generous pledges so far.\\\"\\n\\nThe Bush administration has pledged $350 million in aid for the relief effort. Critics have been quick to compare this to the $177 million spent every day in Iraq to conduct war in that country. In comparison, there was a $500 million pledge made recently by the government of Japan.\\n\\nIndependently of the government, individual Americans have been directly contributing money to aid organizations. Amazon.com placed a link for the American Red Cross, collecting more than $8 million from 100,000 people as of Friday, December 31st. 12,000 donors have donated over $1.2 million to the Red Cross through Yahoo.com.\\n\\nScores of International aid organizations are accepting donations for helping victims of the earthquake and tsunami. Many major companies including Apple Computer, Microsoft, Cisco, eBay, Google, and AOL are helping enable donations through the web.\",\"8.8 magnitude earthquake hits Chile; tsunami warnings issued throughout Pacific rim\\n\\nSaturday, February 27, 2010 \\n\\nAn 8.8 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Chile on Saturday, killing at least 214 people and causing significant structural damage. The earthquake was felt in Chillan, Talca, Concepcion, and the capital Santiago. Sea level recording triggered tsunami warnings for Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. The earthquake, which started at 06.34.14 UTC, was felt as far as Argentina.\\n\\nThis earthquake occurred at the boundary between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates. The two plates are converging at a rate of 80 millimeters per year.\\n\\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has announced that a tsunami warning is in effect for much of the Pacific Rim, including parts of Oceania and Central America.\\n\\nAccording to the BBC, \\\"large waves\\\" have struck Chile's Juan Fern\\u00e1ndez Islands, reaching halfway into one inhabited area. Three people are missing local media says. Reuters reported the Tsunami hit Tahiti at 16.50 UTC, where the BBC reports that the first waves were \\\"smaller,\\\" measuring only 36 centimeters.\\n\\nAccording to the AFP, part of the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia was hit by a 13 foot wave. No casualties have been reported.\\n\\nThe New Zealand Herald reported New Zealand evacuated coastal areas at 8:00 AM local time (18.00 UTC). Waves of 20 centimeters or less were reported at the Chatham Islands (400 miles from the New Zealand mainland) at 19.05 UTC. The Ministry of Civil Defense told the BBC that \\\"the greatest wave heights will occur between six and 12 hours after the initial arrivals.\\\"\\n\\nCoastal waters in Hilo, Hawaii were reported as \\\"visibly receding\\\" at 11:30 AM local time (21.30 UTC) by Hawaii News Now. According to MSNBC, a 5 1\\u002f2 foot wave reportedly made land fall on Hilo Bay, Hawaii a short while after 12:00 P.M. local time (22.00 UTC).\",\"\\\"Bali Roadmap\\\" agreed on, applauded\\n\\nSaturday, December 15, 2007\\n\\nAfter the United States agreed to the changes proposed by India this morning, the so called Bali Roadmap has been agreed on, to applause from all parties. The decision was made at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali. The Roadmap establishes a time frame and scope for reaching a post-2012 climate change agreement. This includes setting, for industrialized nations, targets for reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous observers and parties had voiced that they see this as being of great importance prior to and during the conference.\\n\\nFollowing the reopening of the plenary at midday, India reiterated its position that part of a paragraph needed to be reformulated. The EU went on to state that in the spirit of negotiations, they agreed with the proposed changes. After some further statements by other nations, the US said that they can not accept the changes, as they would considerably change the balance of the text. This was met with loudly audible booing in the plenary. Some time later, after a number of other nations voiced their opinions and the American delegation could be seen busily debating and writing, the US said they would agree to the consensus position after all. Standing ovations and cheers welcomed this change in position, which allowed the President of the Conference soon thereafter to declare the document decided.\\n\\nIndia this morning had raised objections on one of the central documents of what constitutes the Roadmap. This had made a decision impossible for the time being, as the conference can only pass items unanimously. The objection regarded the phrasing of how nations with developing industries are to take action to slow and reduce their GHG emissions. The President of the Conference, the Indonesian Environmental Minister, had declined the request, stating that the proposal he had made was very finely balanced. The President had then suspended the session so that further consultations could be made.\\n\\nNo progress was made when the meeting was reopened about an hour later, with China stating that negotiations of the so called Group of 77 and China with the Indonesian Minister of Finance were still ongoing. China then accused the UNFCCC secretariat of deliberately opening the plenary session at a time it knew that their Ministers were in talks. The Chinese delegate went on to demand an apology by the secretariat, and the meeting was again suspended.\\n\\nYesterday's negotiations\\n\\nMinisterial negotiations had continued through the night until the early morning hours yesterday and the climate conference had been scheduled to decide on the last outstanding items this morning.\\n\\nYesterday evening Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC had said that the parties were \\\"on the brink of agreement\\\", when he was asked where negotiations currently stand. With almost all open matters having been agreed on by a group of 40 ministers, one of the last outstanding points then was still the question of guideline numbers for GHG cuts.\\n\\nSome of the issues that had still been open the day before yesterday (for example how deforestation was to be addressed and the matter of financial support for developing countries to send and support negotiators to the UN climate conferences), had apparently been addressed to everyones satisfaction during yesterdays informal talks. But the talks were still on with regard to preambular text of a document that states how further action to mitigate climate change is to be taken, the inclusion of a 25-40% range for reductions in GHG emissions for industrialized nations by 2020 from 1990 levels being contested.\\n\\nThe draft decision proposed by the President of the Conference today however, no longer included the numbers, but did make reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year.\",\"Ties found between Abu Ghraib prison abuse and Guantanamo Bay\\n\\nThursday, July 28, 2005 \\n\\nIn testimony at a military hearing yesterday on abuses at the U.S. prison camp in Iraq, the former warden of Abu Ghraib, Maj. David Dinenna, said he attended in September 2003 a meeting with Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, who was then commander of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp. Maj. Dinenna said Gen. Miller recommended using dogs, because of their effectiveness.\\n\\nTwo dog handler soldiers at Abu Ghraib stand accused in the hearing. Sgt. Santos A. Cardona, 31, and Sgt. Michael J. Smith, 24, are alleged to have used the dogs to threaten and intimidate prisoners. During the defendants' testimony on Tuesday, they said the interrogation techniques used by them on prisoners was learned from a team of interrogators that was dispatched to Iraq from the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba.\\n\\nThe Article 32 military court proceeding, which concluded Wednesday in Fort Meade, Maryland, is a preliminary hearing to hear prosecution and defense arguments in the case. The Prosecution is seeking a court-martial with claims that the defendants acted criminally. The Defense contends the soldiers were following orders, and that the charges should be dropped.\\n\\nThe investigating officer of the military court, Maj. Glenn Simpkins, has two weeks to weigh the evidence that was presented. Some or all charges could be dropped, but if some charges stand, he will make a recommendation on how Sgts. Cardona and Smith should be dealt with when it goes to trial.\\n\\nThe two accused said in yesterday\\u2019s testimony that Col. Thomas M. Pappas, the top military intelligence officer at Abu Ghraib, approved the use of the dogs. Testimony was also heard from Pvt. Ivan L. \\u201cChip\\u201d Frederick, now serving an 8-year sentence in Fort Leavenworth for his role as ringleader in the abuse, who testified by phone from prison that approval was given to use the dogs, and that a civilian interrogator was also sometimes involved in directing which prisoner cells were to be visited by dog handlers.\\n\\nIn addition to the use of dogs, aggressive interrogation techniques such as clothing removal and sleep deprivation were also part of the series of abuses. Staff Sgt. James Vincent Lucas previously had told Army investigators in Guantanamo that he left Cuba in 2003 to go to Iraq where he, as a member of a 6-man team, taught the \\u201clessons learned\\u201d at Guantanamo, and served to \\u201cprovide guidelines\\u201d to interrogators at Abu Ghraib.\\n\\nLegislation sponsored by several Senate Republicans seeks to specifically regulate the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo and other military prisons. A co-sponsor of the bill, Lindsey Graham (R-SC), recently released declassified internal memos dating from 2003 and written by top military lawyers. They warned the Pentagon about the aggressive tactics at Guantanamo. The memos noted it would heighten the dangers for U.S. troops caught by the enemy.\\n\\nArmy charge sheets accuse Cardona and Smith with maltreating detainees from November 15, 2003, to January 15, 2004 by \\\"directing, encouraging, or permitting [their] unmuzzled military working dog[s] to bark and growl at detainees in order to unlawfully harass and threaten the detainees and in order to make the detainees urinate or defecate on themselves.\\\"\\n\\nCardona, of Fullerton, with the 42nd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Bragg, N.C., was charged with nine counts. Smith, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with the 523rd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Riley, Kan., was charged with 14 counts.\",\"US General invokes right against self-incrimination in Abu Ghraib case\\n\\nThursday, January 12, 2006  \\n\\nMaj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, a top US commander who supervised the detention and interrogation of detainees at Guantanomo Bay and Abu Ghraib facilities declined to testify in a court-martial proceeding, by invoking his right to not implicate himself, the Washington Post reports. This is believed to be the first time that the role of senior officers in the prisoner abuse scandal has formally surfaced.\\n\\nGen. Miller declined to testify during the court-martial trial involving two dog-handlers who are accused of detainee abuse. An attorney for one of the accused is seeking to question Miller on whether he ordered the use of dogs to frighten detainees during interrogations.\\n\\nGen. Miller's lawyer has stated that the decision to decline testifying was taken as Miller has been repeatedly interviewed over the last several years, and that he stands by his previous statements made to Congress, Army Investigators and lawyers.\",\"Climate Negotiations soon to conclude in Bali; UN \\\"concerned by the pace of things\\\"\\n\\nThursday, December 13, 2007\\n\\nAfter almost two weeks of negotiations, this years United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNCCC) is soon going to end, Friday being scheduled as the last day of the talks, with an extension until Saturday being possible if agreement can not be reached beforehand.\\n\\nWhile the head of the UNFCCC Secretariat, Yvo de Boer, stressed from the onset that actual targets for emission reductions were not to be expected to be agreed on, the inclusion of a target frame for industrialized nations is being debated after all. However, his stated goal of deciding on a roadmap for negotiations, which he said needed to address the matter of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reductions after 2012, and would have to be concluded by 2009, is not yet achieved, there being disagreement on a matter of points.\\n\\nChina for example restated a position it had made at the beginning of the first week, calling for 2010 as target year for the so called \\\"Bali Roadmap\\\".\\n\\nBut a bigger point of contention is that the EU and the vast majority of the 190 nations participating in the conference want to set a target of a 25-40% cut in GHG emissions. The U.S., along with Canada and Japan, are refusing to agree to any targets at this point.\\n\\nThe EU and others say it is important to set targets now, to get a head start in the fight against global warming. The U.S. says targets should come later, after negotiations begin.\\n\\nThe latest to be heard by Sean Heron, who is reporting on behalf of the Wikinews on site, regarding the ongoing negotiations was a statement by a Pakistani official, saying that the US had made a new proposal, and that he was feeling more optimistic than he had the day before. The official spoke in the press conference room, excusing the Ambassador Munir Akram, who was supposed to give a briefing on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, but couldn't make it, as negotiations, due also to the new American suggestion, were still ongoing at 11 pm local time.\",\"ETA places explosives on Tour de France route in Spain\\n\\nWednesday, July 25, 2007\\n\\nAuthorities in Spain say that at least two explosive devices were found on a section of the Tour de France bicycle race just outside the Spanish town of Belagua. Authorities say that \\\"a small amount of explosives\\\", were placed inside plastic food containers then placed on both sides of the road.\\n\\nThere are no reports of injuries but conflicting reports say that the cyclists passed the area before the devices went off, while others report that the devices were detonated before the cyclists passed.\\n\\nThe Basque separatist group known as the ETA have claimed responsibility for placing the devices on the route. A telephone call was placed to authorities by someone claiming to be from the ETA who threatened to use the devices.\",\"Protests surround London Olympic torch relay\\n\\nSunday, April 6, 2008 \\n\\nAround 25 arrests have been made by Metropolitan Police officers, during the 31 mile Olympic Torch relay in London, England.\\n\\nThe torch relay began at Wembley Stadium where protesters waved flags and chanted as the torch started on its route. Protests then became more dramatic, as demonstrators attempted to extinguish the flame using a fire extinguisher, and grab the torch from the hands of TV presenter Konnie Huq in Ladbroke Grove. Both of the attempts were unsuccessful, and were prevented by police officers and members of the torch's security team.\\n\\nThe torch continued its route, surrounded by more than twenty security officers, to be seen by hundreds of spectators, and also continued verbal protests by groups highlighting the human rights issues in China. There were also pro-China protesters present chanting slogans. It is believed that around 20 - 25 arrests have been made throughout the course of the day.\\n\\nThe route ends at the O2 Arena after being carried by around 80 athletes, dignitaries and entertainers, including five time Olympic gold medal winner Sir Steve Redgrave.\",\"Olympic torch extinguished three times in Paris\\n\\nMonday, April 7, 2008 \\n\\nToday, the Olympic torch went out three times while traveling through Paris, France. Olympic officials claim that this came as a result of actions by Pro-Tibetan protesters. It has been reported that the torch was extinguished, then put on a bus to keep it safe. The torch was extinguished one time by a Chinese official when the torch was in the hands of David Douillet, and one time due to technical problems.\\n\\nSylvain Garel, of the Green Party and member of the Paris City Council tried to catch the torch from bearer Stephane Diagana's hands.\\n\\nA ceremony on City Hall Plaza was canceled, \\\"by Chinese officials\\\" according to Paris' mayor Bertrand Delano\\u00eb. A banner with \\\"Paris defends human rights around the world\\\" was installed on the City Hall. Reporters without Borders, head of the protest in France, put a banner on the Eiffel Tower and on Notre-Dame de Paris by its Secretary-General Robert M\\u00e9nard.\\n\\nThis action comes soon after the official news agency of China described the actions by the protesters as \\\"vile misdeeds\\\". A spokesman for Beijing 2008 said \\u201cthe torch represents the Olympic spirit and people welcome the torch.\\u201d\\n\\nA spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee said that the IOC is concerned about the situation in Tibet, although they do not encourage people to disrupt the ceremonies. The spokesperson said \\\"The International Olympic Committee has expressed its serious concern and calls for a rapid peaceful resolution in Tibet.\\\" He did, however, say that the style of protesting was \\\"not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the Olympic Games\\\".\\n\\nThe BBC has reported that 500 protesters were present in Paris today. Yesterday, protesters tried to grab and extinguish the torch in London, without success. The events were not broadcast live, as a Chinese Committee demanded to screen the footage prior to broadcast.\",\"Tour de France: Alexander Vinokourov wins stage 13\\n\\nSaturday, July 21, 2007\\n\\nAlexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan has won stage 13 of the 2007 Tour de France. Vinokourov finished the 54 km individual time trial, centered around Albi, in a time of 1h 12' 06\\\".\\n\\nMichael Rasmussen of Denmark held on to his overall lead, finishing 11th in the stage. Alejandro Valverde and Iban Mayo both lost ground in the overall. Cadel Evans gained ground on Rasmussen and is now just one minute behind.\\n\\nThis stage provided the first shake-up in the standings in days. Valverde and Mayo, who were previously second and third, have dropped out of the top ten. Pre-Tour favorite, Vinokourov, was able to use his stage victory to return to the top ten for the first time since stage 2.\\n\\nRasmussen did better than some expected. Afterwards he said: \\\"I thought I had a fair chance, but from thinking to doing that can be a long way. I was a bit in trouble in the first 15 km, but in the last 30 km I did very well.\\\"\\n\\nJust yesterday, Rasmussen was suspended by the Danish Cycling Federation because of a warning from anti-doping authorities within the Union Cycliste Internationale. There has not been a positive test, but the warning was issued for not keeping UCI informed of his whereabouts.\\n\\n\\\"I do admit I committed an administrative error,\\\" said Rasmussen. \\\"I have already received a warning from the UCI but I am very calm and very relaxed.\\\" He continued, \\\"I know a lot of riders who have received warnings for not giving updated information to the UCI. I'm just one out of many and it's just that I happen to have the yellow jersey.\\\"\\n\\nTomorrow's stage will take the race into the Pyrenees. This stage starts with a category 2 climb out of Mazamet and then follows a relatively calm route via Carcassonne, Limoux and Quillan before taking on the Port de Pailh\\u00e8res (17 km at 7.2%) and a very difficult finish at Plateau-de-Beille (16 km at 7.9%).\",\"Five found guilty of UK bomb plot\\n\\nTuesday, May 1, 2007\\n\\nFive men were found guilty Monday for their part in an unsuccessful plot to carry out bombings in the UK. The five had been arrested in 2004 in a police raid named Operation Crevice. Two other men arrested and charged at the time were found not guilty.\\n\\nThe trial at the Old Bailey criminal court in London took place over the past year and had been carried out with little detail being released. It has now been revealed that the guilty had planned large fertiliser bombings of a nightclub, gas power plant and shopping mall. All five were found guilty of plotting to cause an explosion likely to endanger life and have been jailed with life sentences.\\n\\nThe five convicted are Omar Khyam, 25, Waheed Mahmood, 34, and Jawad Akbar, 23, from Crawley, West Sussex, Salahuddin Amin, 31, from Luton, Bedfordshire and Anthony Garcia, 24, of Barkingside, east London. All of the men are British citizens. The two men found not guilty are Nabeel Hussain and Shujah Mahmood.\\n\\nDuring summations, the judge, Sir Michael Astill, criticised the guilty men for plotting against their country. \\\"You have betrayed this country that has given you every opportunity,\\\" said judge Astill. \\\"All of you may never be released. It's not a foregone conclusion.\\\"\\n\\nIt was also revealed that some of the fertiliser bomb conspirators had met with two of the London subway bombers. Opposition parties have now called for an independent inquiry into the 7 July link. The details of the 7 July link had not been brought in front of the jury during the trial of the fertiliser bomb planners.\\n\\nA Canadian man, Momin Khawaja, was arrested in 2004 and has been held in a Canadian jail ever since. He is accused of being a co-conspirator with five British plotters for allegedly developing bomb detonators. Khawaja is considered an un-indicted co-conspirator with relation to the British case. Khawaja is the first person to be held under the 2001 Anti-Terrorism Act under Canada's Criminal Code, put in place by Canada's then Liberal government. Khawaja has been charged with seven offences under the new laws.\\n\\n\\\"He's been in custody for more than three years, facing these charges,\\\" said Lawrence Greenspon, Khawaja's lawyer. \\\"The (British) jury obviously had a great deal of difficulty coming to a decision,\\\" Greenspon told CTV News. \\\"Even with that, two of the seven were acquitted.\\\"\",\"Saskatchewan town asks for return of \\\"accidental\\\" tsunami donation\\n\\nThursday, January 27, 2005\\n\\nMeadow Lake, Saskatchewan \\u2013 The municipal council of a small town in Canada's Prairies has said it \\\"accidentally\\\" donated $10,000 to the Red Cross for tsunami relief. Now it wants its money back.\\n\\nThe council approved the donation during a Jan. 10 meeting by 3 votes to 2. However, the mayor was in the hospital and the deputy mayor, Barry Lewis, who substituted didn't realize he could vote. If he had voted, it would have been against the donation.\\n\\nSome townspeople accused councillor Dorothy Lockwood of ambushing the meeting by presenting the last-minute proposal to divert money from the town's centennial fireworks fund. Lockwood claimed the timing was urgent as the federal government's deadline for matching donations was the next day at midnight.\\n\\nThe Red Cross has already deposited the cheque, but has indicated it will return the money.\",\"Iran 'suspends' releasing British soldiers; Shots fired near Iranian Consul in Basra, Iraq\\n\\nThursday, March 29, 2007\\n\\nIran's National Security Council has announced that it will \\\"suspend\\\" the releasing of 15 British sailors and marines detained by Iranian forces on March 23.\\n\\n\\\"We had decided to release the lady in the group, but with the political ballyhoo by London, this decision will be for the time- being suspended,\\\" said Iranian National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani.

What you have to do when you are engaged with people like the Iranian regime, you have to keep explaining to them, very patiently, what it is necessary to do and at the same time make them fully aware there are further measures that will be taken if they're not prepared to be reasonable. What you can't do is end up negotiating over hostages; end up saying there's some quid pro quo or tit for tat; that's not acceptable,\\\" said Tony Blair, the U.K.'s Prime Minister.\\n\\nIran also stated on Iranian state-run radio that if the United Kingdom goes to the United Nations Security Council or further freezes relations with the nation, they will further delay the release of the soldiers.\\n\\nAccording to the Reuters news agency, the United Kingdom is circulating a 15-page draft statement for approval by the U.N. Security Council \\\"deploring\\\" the continuing detention and endorsing UK's stand that the soldiers \\\"were operating in Iraqi waters as part of the Multinational Force-Iraq under a mandate from the Security Council ....and at the request of the government of Iraq.

He urged the two largest carbon-emitting countries - the United States and China - to make what he called the \\\"boldest moves\\\" to fight global warming.\\n\\nThe United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 international pact that requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. China was not required to reduce emissions under the deal. They also refused today to approve a new treaty designed to cut emissions by 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020.\\n\\nGore said he would go to the U.N. climate meeting in Bali later this week to urge world leaders to meet as often as every three months to enact a global cap on greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.\\n\\nGore shared the 2007 Nobel prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, represented at today's ceremony by Rajendra Pachauri.\\n\\nPachauri stressed the link between the fight against climate change and peace.

This disproportionate impact will lead to problems for years to come unless everyone working on the aid effort addresses the issue now.

We all need to wake up to this issue and ensure the protection, inclusion and empowerment of the women that have survived,\\u201d said, Becky Buell, Oxfam\\u2019s Policy Director.\\n\\nAs well as recognition of the disparity, and further research, Oxfam calls for a number of practical measures including assistance for men in affected areas to \\\"adapt to changing gender roles including caring of children\\\" and better protection for women, who may be finding themselves severely outnumbered by men.\\n\\nBeached boat in Galle, Sri Lanca after 2004 Tsunami\\n\\nAs well as reporting that workers on the ground have been \\\"becoming increasingly aware that a disproportionate percentage of the fatalities there were female\\\", the study looks in detail at a number of locations in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India, the three countries with greatest death toll from the disaster, and finds consistently that women killed outnumber men.\\n\\nThe differences are explained in the report as originating both in differences in ability -- more men can swim and climb trees in the affected areas than women, and men are generally physically stronger -- as well as in differences in activity that the individuals were engaged in at the time the tsunami struck -- many women in Aceh were indoors at home with the children on a Sunday morning, while many men were fishing at sea, or on errands.\\n\\nIn India, many of the women were waiting at the sea-shore for men to bring home the catch, when the wave hit. The wave at sea had not yet broken, and so posed no threat to vessels far enough from shore.\\n\\nIn Sri Lanka in Batticoloa District, the tsunami hit at the hour women on the east coast usually took their baths in the sea.\\n\\nWomen looking after children at the time of the tidal wave were further distracted by trying to save their children, while men away from the house were able to dedicate more of their efforts to saving themselves.\\n\\nAnother factor particularly important in Aceh was that many of the men of the region had left to seek work elsewhere, while women stayed behind in their home community, which was almost completely wiped out by the wave.\\n\\nThe survey looked at Aceh Besar district of Indonesia, the North Aceh district, the two worst-affected districts of Tamil Naidu in South India, being Nagapattinam and Cuddalore, and used rough statistics and anecdotal information from Sri Lanka, where hard figures are not available.\",\"Volunteers collaborate in reconstruction of Lolol, Chile\\n\\nSaturday, May 22, 2010\\n\\nToday, the day of the National Monuments of Chile, a group of volunteers from Santiago travelled to Lolol, a town located in O'Higgins Region.

The media, consisting of 74 photographs and 3 videos, were ordered for release on September 29, pending a 20 day opportunity for appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act Request in a motion to release the photos.\\n\\nThe Bush administration has claimed that the ordered media might provoke terrorists organizations into harming more American soldiers and citizens abroad. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein strongly disagreed, saying that suppressing the pictures amounts to submitting to blackmail. In a statement, Hellerstein said: \\\"Our nation [United States] does not surrender to blackmail, and fear of blackmail is not a legally sufficient argument to prevent us from performing a statutory command.\\\"\",\"Olympic torch faces protests in San Francisco\\n\\nWednesday, April 9, 2008\\n\\nThe Olympic torch relay in San Francisco, California, began today at 1:00 p.m. PDT (UTC-7). It was the only stop for the torch in the United States, as it makes its way around the world to Beijing, China, for the 2008 Summer Olympics.\\n\\nThe route for the torch was materially altered as protesters filled the streets along the planned route. The route, which was originally 10 kilometres long, was shortened by nearly half, according to the San Francisco Police Department. In hopes that all eighty of the scheduled torch carriers would get a chance to carry the torch, the carriers ran in pairs.\\n\\nThe first torch carrier ran as scheduled, but then carried it into a warehouse, from which a motorcycle was observed leaving. The torch was then spotted again on a major street nearly two miles off course.\\n\\nThe rerouting was carefully planned, according to San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, who told Associated Press, that it was because of \\\"a disproportionate concentration of people in and around the start of the relay.\\\"\\n\\nThe closing ceremonies were held at San Francisco International Airport instead of the planned waterfront location at AT&T Park.\\n\\nMatt Helmenstine, 30, a California high school teacher carrying a Tibetan flag told Reuters: \\\"I think it's cowardly. If they can't run the torch through the city, it means that no one is supporting the games.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for us to see the torch,\\\" said Nancy Chan, a local resident, to the San Francisco Chronicle. \\\"There is a lot of politics around it, but that is the great thing about America - the free speech.\\\" She and her 4-year-old son ran to the new route when it was announced.\\n\\nAt least one protester was arrested, Xiao Tan, 32, of Chinese origin, who tried to unfurl a Tibetan flag. \\\"I'm proud to be Chinese, but I don't like what's happening in Tibet,\\\" he told AFP. The Vancouver Sun reported a number of arrests, but says that violence is limited.\\n\\nPeter Ueberroth, the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee, said that the right balance had been reached, between preserving freedom of speech for protesters, while still providing an exhilarating experience for torchbearers, as well as preventing a repeat of the chaotic demonstrations that accompanied the torch in London and Paris.\\n\\nAlready Tuesday evening, hundreds paraded with Tibetan flags while chanting \\\"Shame on China\\\". On Monday, protesters hung banners from the Golden Gate Bridge. As the torch went to London and Paris, the torch relay was subject to large scale protests in both cities.\\n\\nTight security was planned in advance. Airspace restrictions have been put in place and over 700 security personnel are expected to be deployed including FBI agents. Police leave was cancelled. The United States Coast Guard patrolled the part of the route that was to take the torch along the waterfront at Fisherman's Wharf.\\n\\n\\\"We are trying to accomplish two goals here. One is to protect the right to free speech and the other is to ensure public safety, and here in San Francisco we are good at both of those things,\\\" said Nathan Ballard about the security. Ballard is a spokesperson for San Francisco Mayor's office.\\n\\n\\\"I am saddened that such a beautiful symbol of the torch, which unites people of different religions, different ethnic origin, different political systems, cultures and languages, has been attacked,\\\" said Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, to the Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nThe Beijing Organizing Committee said in a statement on Monday: \\\"We strongly condemn the actions of the few 'pro-Tibet independence' activists who have attempted to sabotage the Olympic Torch Relay. The Olympic flame belongs to the world and these actions are a serious violation of the Olympic spirit. They are bound to fail and will surely arouse the resentment of peace-loving people who support the Olympic Games.\\\"\",\"London bombing: Police search houses in Leeds\\n\\nTuesday, July 12, 2005\\n\\nWest Yorkshire Police searched six houses in Leeds today in connection with the London bombings. Houses were searched in the Burley, Beeston and Holbeck areas. Further properties were searched in Dewsbury, about eight miles from the city centre. The raids began at 6:30am BST this morning after warrants were issued under the Terrorism Act 2000. Police are still in attendance at one property, and are describing the searches as significant, and \\\"intelligence led\\\".\\n\\nAccess to one house was gained using a robot-deployed controlled explosion. Other houses were entered by armed police.\\n\\nLondon Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair said that the operation \\\"is directly connected to the outrages on Thursday\\\". A \\\"significant amount\\\" of explosives was recovered from the Burley property. Following the discovery of the explosive, military bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene. Around 600 people were evacuated from the surrounding area. Temporary food and shelter is being provided by the local council at Kirkstall Leisure Centre, a mile away.\",\"Torch of 2008 Summer Olympics won't travel through Taiwan\\n\\nSaturday, September 22, 2007\\n\\nAfter lots of turns on the route of torch relay of 2008 Summer Olympics, Taiwan and China still insisted their own political positions. The IOC finally announced yesterday that the torch's route will not cross Taiwan.\\n\\nAfter the route was fixed by IOC, politicians and governments in Taiwan criticized China's behavior.\\n\\nOne of Taiwan's 2008 presidential candidates, Ying-jiou Ma (former Taipei City Mayor), commented that without the torch, he can not welcome the torch with National Song and Flag of the Republic of China. Also, Chih-hsiung Huang (KMT Legislator) supposed that Mainland China and Democratic Progressive Party should be criticized on this fault.\\n\\nAt the governmental level, Ming-tung Chen (Commissioner of Mainland Affairs Council of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China) mentioned that people in Taiwan do not accept the request on welcoming the torch of 2008 Summer Olympics without Flags, Symbols, and the National Song of the Republic of China, based on the cross-strait common consensus on February 12, 2007. Chun-hsiung Chang (Premier of the Republic of China) hoped that this fault won't take effect on the tourism between China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Chih-Wei Hsieh (Minister of the Government Information Office of the Republic of China) was proud of the protection of democracy and human rights in Taiwan even though the torch of 2008 Summer Olympics won't come to Taiwan.\\n\\nAccording to Eastern Television in Taiwan, the reciprocal consensus' between China and Taiwan became cracked slowly, especially in such sporting events as:\\n\\n    * Flag of the Republic of China was shown at Davis Cup in Taiwan at April, Cross-Strait Golf Championship and Asian Volleyball Championship at July. This was said to anger the Mainland China National Team.\\n    * Mainland China National Team withdrew the 2007 World Deaf Swimming Championship and YONEX 2007 Chinese Taipei Badminton Open.\\n    * Ta Meng (Basketball Player of Jiangsu Nangang Team) deliberately elbowed Tai-Hao Wu at Cross-Strait Basketball Championship on September 4, 2007, and caused some spectators in Taiwan to protest Chinese Taipei Basketball Association and China by drawing Flags of the Republic of China.\\n\\nThis Olympic Torch is first-ever declined by an IOC member without warfare factor, even though IOC won't punish Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), but this indicates that the 2008 Summer Olympics may be more faded with politics than previously has occurred.\\n\\nThe effects are indicated to be notable after Executive Yuan of Taiwan will promote the \\\"Torch of Joining UN\\\" in October 2007 and the \\\"Human Rights Torch Relay\\\" project by Taiwan newspaper Epoch Times in June 2008.\",\"Four aftershocks hit central Chile; no damages reported\\n\\nSunday, November 28, 2010 \\n\\nFour strong aftershocks have occurred on today's early morning in Chile.

Climate Change Conference being held in Bali.\\n\\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon told reporters it may be too \\\"ambitious\\\" to set targets for greenhouse-gas emissions in the draft text of an agreement aimed at replacing the Kyoto Protocol to stop global warming.\\n\\nDelegates from about 190 nations, now holding high-level meetings, are split over whether targets should be set now or later. Mr. Ban recognizes the divisions.\\n\\n\\\"Frankly speaking, realistically, it may be too ambitious if delegates would expect to be able to agree on target of greenhouse gas emission reduction,\\\" he said. \\\"But, as I told you, some time down the road we will have to agree on that.\\\"\\n\\nMinisters and heads of states, in a series of speeches, urged nations to lower greenhouse gas emissions. These gases, particularly those caused by the burning of fuels, are believed by many scientists to contribute to global warming.\\n\\nLeaders said rich nations should make the first cuts and help poorer nations to develop clean technology.\\n\\nThe United States strongly opposes emission targets, as do Japan and Canada. U.S. officials say including emission targets would prejudge negotiations expected over the next two years to find a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.\\n\\nBut the European Union and environmentalists say setting emission targets in the draft will show that industrialized nations are serious about the fight against global warming.\\n\\nThe U.S. under-secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, Paula Dobriansky, who is heading the U.S. delegation to Bali, says Washington is committed to seeing an agreement reached at the Bali conference.\\n\\n\\\"We are very committed to working toward a successful outcome here in Bali. We want to launch a process that is open and does not predetermine or preclude options,\\\" she said. \\\"We have been listening carefully to the perspectives of others and will continue to do so in the days ahead. We hope to identify a way forward that will bridge our differences and bring us together on common pursuit of our shared goal of addressing climate change.\\\"\\n\\nThe text of the conference draft is expected to undergo several revisions before being finalized Friday. It calls for industrialized nations to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 to 40 percent by the year 2020.\\n\\nThe Bali conference is expected to end on Friday.\",\"US government to resume Haiti evacuations\\n\\nTuesday, February 2, 2010 \\n\\nThe United States government will resume evacuation flights for injured Haitians following doctors advising that many were likely to die if they did not receive immediate medical care. Airlifts stopped Wednesday due to logistical issues. Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said on Sunday that airlifts should resume within the next twelve hours.\\n\\nVietor said Haitians with spinal injuries and burns were flown to the U.S., most for treatment in Florida. The state's governor, Charlie Crist, advised the Obama administration last week that Florida's healthcare system was be called on to deal with a considerable number of injured from Haiti; that victims had high-trauma injuries, only increasing the strain on the healthcare system available in Florida. Crist requested the Federal Government activate the National Disaster Medical System, which often provides the necessary funds for disaster victims.\\n\\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) also began delivering food to Haitian women on Sunday. A spokesperson stated that they had decided to only release food to the women in an effort to reduce violence caused by the starvation dilemma. Rice was distributed in sixteen locations across Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. The WFP gave 25kg (or 55 pounds) of rice to each woman, enough rice to feed an average family in Haiti for two weeks.\",\"UK naval crew describe their capture and detention by Iran\\n\\nFriday, April 6, 2007\\n\\nAt a press conference held Friday at the Royal Marine Base Chivenor in Devon, first-hand details of the fifteen UK Royal Navy crew's capture and detention by Iran were revealed.\\n\\nThe fifteen navy crew, eight from the Royal Navy (RN) and seven from the Royal Marines (RM), arrived by helicopter at the base on Thursday. Following a period of debriefing and rest, the crew spoke at a press conference on Friday. Captain Christopher Air, RM, and Lieutenant Felix Carman, RN, spoke for the group.\\n\\nCarman and Air thanked the staff of the British Embassy in Tehran, the Foreign Office, and Ministry of Defence for securing their release. In addition, Air stated that the crew \\\"would like to thank the very many members of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who have been working so hard over the last 2 weeks supporting our families and friends and for arranging our return to here.\\\"\\n\\nCarman provided details of the navigational equipment and hand held GPS used by the UK crew. A support helicopter also provided continuous navigational confirmation. The boarding crew were linked electronically to HMS Cornwall, which monitored the crew's position continually. \\\"Let me make it absolutely clear,\\\" said Carman. \\\"Irrespective of what has been said in the past, when we were detained by the IRG we were inside internationally recognised Iraqi territorial waters and I can clearly state we were 1.7 nautical miles from Iranian waters.\\\"\\n\\nHaving boarded an unidentified merchant vessel in the Shatt Al Arab waterway, the crew were stopped by two Iranian boats, which prevented them from leaving. \\\"When we tried to leave, they prevented us by blocking us in,\\\" explained Air. \\\"By now it was becoming increasingly clear that they had arrived with a planned intent. Some of the Iranian sailors were becoming deliberately aggressive and unstable. They rammed our boat and trained their heavy machine guns, RPGs and weapons on us.\\\"\\n\\nSix other Iranian boats arrived. \\\"We made a conscious decision to not engage the Iranians and do as they asked,\\\" said Air. \\\"They boarded our boats, removed our weapons and steered the boats towards the Iranian shore.\\\"\\n\\nOn arrival at an Iranian naval base, the UK crew were stripped of their gear, blindfolded, and led to an interrogation room. The following morning the group was flown to Tehran and transported to a prison where they faced \\\"constant psychological pressure.\\\" The crew were stripped and dressed in pajamas. According to Carman, \\\"the next few nights were spent in stone cells, approximately 8'x 6', sleeping on piles of blankets. All of us were kept in isolation.\\\"\\n\\nThey were interrogated most nights and offered two options. \\\"If we admitted we had strayed, we would be on a plane back to the UK soon,\\\" said Carman. \\\"If we didn't we faced up to seven years in prison.\\\" The crew were kept in isolation until the last few nights, when they were allowed to gather together for a couple of hours at a time.\\n\\nOn the subject of deciding to resist the Iranians or not, Air was adamant that it would have made the situation worse. \\\"Let me be absolutely clear, from the outset it was very apparent that fighting back was simply not an option,\\\" said Air. \\\"Had we chosen to do so then many of us would not be standing here today.\\\"\",\"US nationals arrested for alleged abduction of Haitian children\\n\\nMonday, February 1, 2010 \\n\\nHaitian police yesterday arrested ten United States nationals, five men and five women, over the alleged abduction of 33 children. The nationals tried to cross with the children, aged between two months and twelve years, into the Dominican Republic, but were halted at the border.\\nLots of children have been affected by the earthquake.\\n\\nThe group belongs to the two-month-old New Life Children's Refuge charity, with some members from Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Eastside Baptist Church in Twin Falls, Idaho, and others from Texas and Kansas. Their claimed intention was to move the quake victims to a temporary orphanage being set up in a hotel-resort in the neighbouring Dominican Republic. Police said the Americans did not have any paperwork or permissions to remove the children from the country. Haiti's government has imposed new restrictions on adoptions due to concerns about child trafficking during the post-disaster confusion.\\n\\nThe detainees are being held near the capital, Port-au-Prince, and maintain their arrest was a mistake. Laura Silsby, the group's spokeswoman, insisted on the group acting in good faith and they paid no money for the children. She defended the lack of any authority from Haitian officials, \\\"I was going to come back here to do the paperwork,\\\" asserting that Haitian pastor Jean Sanbil, of the Sharing Jesus Ministries, allowed them to move the children. She claimed, \\\"[w]e had permission from the Dominican Republic government to bring the children to an orphanage that we have there.\\\"\\n\\nHaitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive disagreed strongly with group's actions; \\\"[w]e did not arrest Americans, we arrested kidnappers.\\\" Social Affairs minister, Yves Christallin, told Agence France-Presse that it was \\\"abduction, not an adoption\\\". He continued, \\\"what is important for us in Haiti is that a child needs to have authorisation from this ministry to leave the country\\\". He stressed, \\\"[t]his is totally illegal, [...] these people did not have that authorization.\\\"\\n\\nKent Page, a spokesman for UNICEF in Haiti, also weighed in today saying, \\\"[y]ou can't just go and take a child out of a country \\u2013 no matter what country you are in.\\\"\\n\\nThe NCLR group planned to take around 100 children to the Dominican Republic. According to their mission statement, the Baptists' intent was to \\\"find healing, hope, joy and new life in Christ\\\" for the Roman Catholic children \\\"as well as opportunities for adoption into a loving Christian family.\\\" To that end they partnered with New Life Adoption Foundation to \\\"help facilitate adoptions and provide grants to subsidize the cost of adoption for loving Christian parents who would otherwise not be able to afford to adopt.\\\" They envisioned building an orphanage at Villa Magante on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, with facilities for the children, and lodging and amenities for \\\"adopting parents to stay while fulfilling requirement for 60\\u201090 day visit as well as Christian volunteers\\u002fvacationing families.\\\"\\n\\nThe children have been transferred to an SOS Children's village in Santo, to the north of the capital. The site has a medical facility run by the Dominican Red Cross. Staff reported the children were \\\"in a very bad emotional state\\\" and that a small baby had to be temporarily taken to the main hospital. Some children told staff they actually have parents, and a twelve year old said she and her family had believed the New Life Children's Refuge group wanted to take her to a boarding school in the Dominican Republic. Later, three people arrived at the SOS Children's village claiming to be relatives of five of the children. They said, \\\"the woman who took the children to DR\\\" told them she organised summer camps in the neighbouring country; they declared they did not intent to permanently part with their children.\\n\\nAmarick Louis, Haiti's justice secretary, told the Associated Press that a commission would decide today if the group would go before a judge. Senior Pastor Clint Henry of the Central Valley Baptist Church told reporters New Life Children's Refuge, and the Haiti mission, are separate from the 25-year-old church. He noted that members of the church were confronted with negative feedback after the arrest of the NLCR group. His congregation prayed for the arrested members of their church during services on Sunday.\",\"New earthquake hits Chile\\n\\nFriday, May 21, 2010 \\n\\nA strong earthquake hit Chile at approximately at 14:52 local time (1852 UTC) on Friday. The United States Geological Survey first reported it reached a preliminary magnitude of 5.5, and the epicenter was located very close to Pichilemu, a coastal town in the O'Higgins Region.

It is called the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries, or REDD proposal.\\n\\nEnvironmental scientists say tree cutting in tropical areas accounts for about 20 percent of all man-made carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming. Tropical forests soak up vast amounts of carbon dioxide; burning timber to clear land releases it.\\n\\nMarcelo Furtado with Greenpeace in Brazil says the REDD plan is needed to fill gaps in the current Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to limit emissions of greenhouse gases which does not include ways to preserve forests.\\n\\n\\\"We would like to see, at the very least, a REDD mechanism moving forward, because we want to see countries taking action now. We don't want to wait to 2013 to start seeing this action taking place. And this is something this convention, this group of countries could deliver,\\\" said Furtado.\\n\\nFrances Seymour, Director General for the Indonesia-based Center for International Forest Research, is concerned a premature REDD agreement could do more harm than good.\\n\\n\\\"Because in many forested countries, land tenure rights to forest lands and resources are either unclear or contested or both. And you can imagine that if a potential new income stream is available for those who can present themselves as owners of the forest, this could create conflict and create conditions under which some of the world's poorest people, who are people who live in forests, could be pushed aside,\\\" said Seymour.\\n\\nFinancial analysts are also cautious about the proposal.\\n\\nCharlotte Streck, the director of Climate Focus, a Rotterdam-based consultancy, said investors are worried about how governments would monitor their forests and ensure the carbon stored in them remains intact.\\n\\n\\\"This is what makes the private sector nervous, because these are risks that they cannot hedge properly, and that they cannot evaluate in the same manner as the project related risks,\\\" she said.\\n\\nConference delegates are still debating how to monitor the world's remaining tropical forests, how to stop logging in one place without shifting the problem to another area, and how to estimate the amount of carbon in a piece of land.\\n\\nYvo de Boer, the U.N.'s climate change chief, said a REDD agreement is unlikely during this conference, but a group working on the details is making significant progress.\",\"British navy personnel back home\\n\\nThursday, April 5, 2007\\n\\nThe fifteen British navy personnel detained by Iran landed at just gone 12:00 noon BST at Heathrow International Airport, following their release after thirteen days of captivity.\\n\\nThe sailors and marines were captured by Iranian border guards on March 23 in the Persian Gulf near the Shatt al Arab waterway.

It claims torture and other abuses against detainees in US custody in Iraq continues and is authorised and routine. The report includes detailed accounts of abuse from detention centers throughout Iraq, and allegations from an Army interrogator stationed at Camp Nama at Baghdad International Airport.\\n\\nThe 55-page report titled No Blood, No Foul: Soldiers' Accounts of Detainee Abuse in Iraq claims that that harsh interrogation techniques were approved by commanders. Soldiers describe how detainees were routinely subjected to severe beatings, painful stress positions, severe sleep deprivation, and exposure to extreme cold and hot temperatures. The accounts come from interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch, supplemented by memoranda and sworn statements contained in declassified documents.\\n\\nMarc Garlasco, Human Rights Watch military analyst, said \\\"Up to now, a lot of allegations and evidence has been floating around about authorization up the chain of command of abusive techniques,\\\" \\\"MPs on trial tried to raise this in their defense and got nowhere. For the first time, we have been provided clear information on the scope of authorization of abusive techniques, and it points directly to officers in charge and the Pentagon.\\\"\\n\\nJohn Sifton, researcher at Human Rights Watch said \\\"Soldiers were told that the Geneva Conventions did not apply, and that interrogators could use abusive techniques to get detainees to talk.\\\"\\n\\nThe Department of Defense denies any Pentagon approval for any abuse.\\n\\nLt. Col. Mark Ballesteros, a Pentagon spokesman says \\\"DoD policy has and always will be the humane treatment of detainees in its custody.\\\" He said there is a task force in Iraq that oversees detainee operations and has made a dozen reviews of detainee policies. None of the reviews found that the Department of Defense ever ordered or condoned detainee abuse.\\n\\nThe Human Rights Watch report recommends appointing a bipartisan commission to investigate the range of detainee abuse in Iraq, overhauling the military justice system, and appointing an independent prosecutor to investigate and prosecute those responsible.\\n\\nMarc Garlasco said \\\"In the current situation of long occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan with troop rotation, there is no reason an independent prosecutor can't deal with abuse allegations,\\\" \\\"It would make a difference if the E-3 (private first class) in the field saw some senior officers or flags that had authorized abuse being tried in courts-martial instead of promoted.\\\"\",\"Tour de France: Alexandre Vinokourov wins stage 15\\n\\nMonday, July 23, 2007\\n\\nAlexandre Vinokourov of Kazakhstan has won stage 15 of the 2007 Tour de France in a time of 5h 34' 28\\\".\\n\\nMichael Rasmussen of Denmark kept his overall lead by 2' 23' over Alberto Contador of Spain.

Dance beats, giant cows, and French tinged words of encouragement, momentarily woke the early birds from their patient wait for the main event. As they waited curious by-passers swapped photography tips, and thoughts on cycling as the youngest members wondered what the fuss was all about. Council workmen commented on how easy it was to get work done, with no car traffic on the roads.\\n\\nAgain the policing was low key and friendly with the Gendarme Nationale cutting a dash amongst their British colleagues. British bobbies rode in French vehicles, and French argents in British ones. Riding well in advance of the Tour, French and British motorcycle policemen swapped tips and compared notes as they passed. The Frenchmen bringing more than a little Gallic charm and swagger to the proceedings.\\n\\nThe crowd behind Jubilee Gardens grew as the start time of twenty-five past ten approached, an event presaged by an ever increasing number of press and support vehicles. As Big Ben chimed the hour in the background a quartet of helicopters in the sky above the River Thames began to jostle for position; a dance mirrored on the ground as anticipation grew. Slowly the dribble that was the vanguard of press and support vehicles became a torrent. A wave of cheers rung out, announcing finally the arrival of the riders. Despite their being almost 190 riders the speeding cyclists had come and gone in a matter of minutes, however the show was not yet over. For a quarter of an hour afterwards tour buses, and still yet more support vehicles followed in the wake of the cyclists. As the police began to remove their restrictions on the crowds and traffic, a final rear guard of race fans emulating their heroes brought up the rear. Despite some not being in the best of condition and some riding rather rickety bikes, these fans still managed to get an enthusiastic cheer of encouragement from the remaining onlookers.\\n\\nWith the Tour continuing on its way and it still not yet 11, some amongst the myriad of spectators began to make their way to the large outside video screens to continue watching the race, others preferring to sample the shops, sights, smells and tastes of the waking City. With some others choosing to sit in the sun, and lie in the park, no doubt making up for an early start.\",\"UK freezes business arrangements with Iran; detained sailors and marines shown on TV\\n\\nWednesday, March 28, 2007\\n\\nThe United Kingdom has frozen all bilateral business deals with Iran until all 15 British sailors and marines, who were detained by Iranian forces on March 23 are released.\\n\\n\\\"We will therefore be imposing a freeze on all other official bilateral business with Iran until this situation is resolved.

European states are pushing for steep reductions in emissions, but environmentalists accuse some others of dragging their feet.\\n\\nThe European Union's climate chief, Artur Runge Metzger, says his organization wants greenhouse emissions cut by half by the middle of the century.\\n\\n\\\"We would like to see global average temperatures rise no more than an average of two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels,\\\" Metzger said. \\\"And that would require that global emissions go down by at least 50 percent of the 1990 emissions by the year 2050.\\\"\\n\\nGreenhouse emissions are thought to be causing global warming. Metzger downplayed differences between the EU and other countries on reduction targets, saying he believes the response to the 50 percent proposal has been increasingly positive. He noted that Japan, Canada and some members of the U.S. congress have expressed support for the idea.\\n\\nThose same countries, however, have been targeted by environmental groups, who say they have failed in their initial statements here to come out strongly enough for significant cuts. Hans Verolme of the group WWF says Japan is being criticized for not including binding targets in its proposal for emission control discussions.\\n\\n\\\"That in our view would be quite disastrous. It would delay action and it would in fact lead to dangerous climate change,\\\" Verolme said.\\n\\nJapan says its proposal is merely an attempt to get the conversation started, and U.N. climate change chief Yvo de Boer has also sought to downplay any differences. De Boer repeatedly points out that the Bali conference is not meant to produce a new climate-change treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol. That 1997 agreement is set to expire in 2012.\\n\\n\\\"This meeting in Bali will not finalize a post-2012 climate change deal, that's much too complicated to do in 10 days, but what it can do is put in place a two-year process to work towards such a deal,\\\" De Boer said.\\n\\nEven the two-degree temperature rise that the European Union talks about is predicted to have serious effects on humans and the environment. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted such a rise would increase the frequency of damaging storms, and make 30 percent of the world's species more vulnerable to extinction.\\n\\nThousands of delegates from more than 180 countries are meeting in Bali, which is due to run through December 14.\",\"Haiti rescue effort abandoned\\n\\nSaturday, January 23, 2010 \\n\\nThe United Nations has announced that the government of Haiti has put an end to its efforts to find and rescue buried survivors of the earthquake that hit the region eleven days ago. The announcement comes just a day after two people were found alive.\\n\\nAccording to Elizabeth Byrs, the UN spokeswoman, 132 people have been rescued since the earthquake hit. The death toll, as of Friday, is estimated to be 110,000. It is thought that the chances of survival are so slim that it is not worth the resources required for a successful rescue operation. Byrs called the decision to end the rescue effort \\\"heartbreaking\\\", but added that it had been advised by experts.\\n\\nOnly yesterday, an 84-year-old woman was found\\u2014severely injured and dehydrated\\u2014in the rubble of her home, and Emmannuel Buso, aged 21, was rescued by an Israeli search team. He said that he was coming out of the shower when the earthquake hit, and survived ten days by drinking his own urine. There is currently no information on whether the Israeli team will also stop their rescue efforts.\\n\\nShortly after the announcement, a French rescue team reported that it was trying to save a man who is trapped under the ruins of a hotel and supermarket. They cannot yet see the man, who said that he saw the team's light, and that as many as five other people are trapped with him. The rescue team said that it could take two hours to rescue the man.\\n\\nIt is hoped that removing focus from the rescue operation will allow more money and effort to be diverted to the logistically difficult relief effort, which has already seen planes arriving at the now operational Port-au-Prince airport at a rate of 150 per day and a United States Navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, moored outside the partly-operational seaport.\\n\\nAt least 130,000 people have been relocated out of Port-au-Prince, say the UN, whose World Food Program has provided approximately 2 million meals to starving people and calls the current operation \\\"the most complex operation WFP has ever launched\\\".\\n\\nThe magnitude 7 earthquake is estimated to have made 1.5 million people homeless, and some estimations of the death toll rise as high as 200,000. More than 75,000 bodies have been recovered and buried in mass graves, while more remain in the streets waiting to be collected.\",\"Climate conference in Bali begins on Monday\\n\\nThursday, November 29, 2007\\n\\nThis year's session of the \\\"United Nations Climate Change Conference\\\", which includes meetings of the COP and CMP, begins next week in Bali, Indonesia.

Several participants and observers agree that getting on track for a regulatory agreement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2012 onwards is going be one of the main challenges in the upcoming talks.\\n\\nSetting an agenda and a date for completion of negotiations on a post-2012 climate change agreement at the upcoming conference in Bali is of great importance, stated Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in an interview given to Inter Press Service last week. De Boer declared that he does not \\\"expect Bali to agree on targets and finalise a regime\\\", and sees the real work in \\\"designing a global agreement that encompasses every country while recognising the need of different approaches with different people\\\" during the short span of the next two years.

While the Kyoto Protocol includes reduction targets for the signatory developed nations through 2012, the communique says that a \\\"new international climate change deal must be put in place\\\" so that no time gap occurs between the current measures to reduce GHGs until the end of the current phase and those measures that will be applied thereafter.\",\"Search in Atlantic underway for missing Air France passenger jet\\n\\nTuesday, June 2, 2009 \\n\\nAircraft and water vessels from the French, American and Brazilian military were searching the Atlantic on Monday after an Air France passenger jet with 228 people on board disappeared over the ocean.\\n\\nSearch teams from Brazil mainly focused on the area north of Fernando de Noronha, an island located approximately two hundred miles off the coast of Brazil. France's military, meanwhile, was several hundred miles away, searching the waters near Cape Verde.\\n\\nAirplanes from Senegal and Spain have also been sent out to help out in the search effort.

I said the truth to them: the prospects of finding survivors are very low,\\\" the president said to reporters at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France. The Pentagon has also ordered aircraft to assist in finding the plane.\\n\\nThe Airbus A330 had departed from Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night, with a dozen crew members and 216 passengers on board, according to a spokeswoman for Air France. The jet was in a normal cruise at 840 kilometres per hour at about 10,700 metres above sea level when it disappeared, almost four hours after having departed. No problems were apparent when the aircraft made its last radar contact.\\n\\nAir France said that the aeroplane \\\"crossed through a thunderous zone with strong turbulence\\\" at about 23.00 local time (02.14 GMT). Approximately fourteen minutes later, an automated message was sent saying that the cabin had lost its pressurisation and that the electrical system of the aircraft had failed.\\n\\nIf no survivors are found, then this would be the worst aviation disaster since the November 2001 American Airlines Flight 587 crash.\",\"Magnitude 6.9 earthquake hits Chile as president is sworn in\\n\\nSaturday, March 13, 2010 \\n\\nA magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck Chile on Thursday, just 21 minutes before the country's new president, Sebasti\\u00e1n Pi\\u00f1era, was due to be sworn in. This earthquake comes several days after a heavy 8.8 magnitude earthquake shook the country, the strongest one in almost half a century.\\n\\nAccording to the US Geological Survey, the quake's epicentre was 135 kilometres (85 miles) south of Valparaiso, where the presidential inauguration took place, and 145 kilometres (90 miles) southwest of capital Santiago. Later, it was reported that the epicenter was offshore Pichilemu, a coastal town in the O'Higgins Region.\\n\\nThe Miami Herald reports that the temblor was among seven aftershocks. There were no reports of damage, injuries, or deaths, although some residents rushed outside after the tremors.\\n\\nAccording to reports by the Associated Press, the Chilean navy called for a tsunami alert and encouraged residents living along shorelines to move to higher ground; however, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center commented that \\\"a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected.\\\"\",\"London bomb suspect returned from Italy\\n\\nThursday, September 22, 2005\\n\\nThe London bomb suspect, Hussain Osman, also known as Hamdi Issac, has arrived in London and been arrested following his extradition from Italy. Allegedly involved in the second set of attacks on London in July, which targeted the city's public transport infrastructure, Osman was arrested in Rome by Italian police on July 29, just one week after the failed attacks.\\n\\nOn September 13, a final appeal against extradition was rejected by an Italian court despite his lawyer's protests that he could not get a fair trial in the UK. Osman is accused of planting the failed bomb at Shepherd's Bush Underground station. His flight subsequent to the attack proved futile as phone records led police to Rome, and a raid on his brother's apartment, where he was captured.\\n\\nPending his extradition, he was held at Rebibbia jail, Rome, a high-security facility on the outskirts of the city. He left the jail late on Thursday and the Ethiopian-born terror suspect flew out of Italy at 12pm local time, accompanied by officers from the Metropolitan police. Flying on a chartered private jet, Osman and his escort landed at RAF Northolt, where Osman was charged on arrival. He is expected to be put on trial at the Old Bailey in London, alongside the other suspects involved in the failed attacks.\",\"Beijing 2008 Olympics comes to a close\\n\\nSunday, August 24, 2008 \\n\\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics were formally declared closed during a colourful ceremony at the iconic Beijing National Stadium with the Olympics flag being handed over to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson.

A spokesman for Floridian governor Charlie Crist, however, commented that he wasn't aware of any hospitals in the state refusing to accept more evacuees. In a letter to US Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius earlier this week, however, the governor commented that \\\"Florida's healthcare system is quickly reaching saturation, especially in the area of high-level trauma care,\\\" and asked for the National Disaster Medical System to be activated. That system is primarily used to help fund victims of domestic disasters.\\n\\nA doctor in the earthquake-ravaged country, however, remarked that many of his patients could die if not airlifted soon. \\\"We have 100 critically ill patients who will die in the next day or two if we don't med-evac them,\\\" said Doctor Green, chairman for the University of Miami's Global Institute for Community Health and Development, to the Associated Press.\\n\\nAn earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.0, struck Haiti on January 12, killing as much as 200,000 people and largely destroying the capital Port-au-Prince; another million have been left without homes.\",\"Authenticity of new Abu Ghraib photos confirmed\\n\\nThursday, February 16, 2006 \\n\\nThe Australian has reported today that the Pentagon has confirmed the authenticity of the images aired by Australian television network SBS. Contradicting claims made by some media outlets, SBS Dateline's executive producer Mike Carey claimed on Thursday that the program's researchers have found cases of Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse that have not been dealt with by US authorities. He described the new images available to SBS as a \\\"quantum leap\\\" compared to the previously broadcast pictures.\\n\\nCarey announced that next week's program will show more abuse pictures, but he noted that some images featuring prisoners in sexually humiliating acts will not be broadcast, as they were deemed too graphic. Next week's program will also include interviews with a US soldier that has been convicted of prisoner abuse and another former soldier who witnessed the crimes.\\n\\nThe Washington Post has noted, as suggested by SBS, that several news outlets including themselves have \\\"not published a substantial number of photographs they are holding.\\\" The Washington Post further explains that \\\"Newspapers that have held these images have been constrained, in large part, by the sheer graphic nature of them, especially the nudity.\\\"\\n\\nThe Washington Post also cites SBS's ability to circumvent \\\"the U.S. government's efforts to keep Abu Ghraib images out of the public eye\\\" as another reason why the images were not first published by other media outlets.\\n\\nThe U.S. internet news site Salon has now published some of their own previously held back pictures and confirmed that they possess \\\"files and other electronic documents from an internal Army investigation into the Abu Ghraib prisoner-abuse scandal\\\", which include the originally published pictures, as well as the ones published by SBS.\\n\\nSalon notes that some of the files from the Criminal Investigation Command refer to CIA agents that interrogated prisoners at Abu Ghraib, but that no CIA officers have been prosecuted \\\"despite the death of at least one Iraqi during a CIA interrogation there\\\", underscoring the claim made by SBS that some of the pictures document previously unprosecuted abuse.\\n\\nThe US government expressed concerns about the new abuse pictures being published. John Bellinger of the State Department told BBC, \\\"We felt that it was an invasion of the privacy of the detainees themselves to have these photographs come out... (and that the publication could also) fan the flames around the world and cause potentially further violence\\\".\",\"USA leaving Abu Ghraib\\n\\nFriday, March 10, 2006\\n\\nUnited States army officers stated that the Abu Ghraib prison will be closed within months, and its prisoners moved to other prisons and camps in Iraq. Some of the 4500 detainees will be sent to the new Camp Cropper, which is built for this special purpose. The operation of Abu Ghraib will be transferred to the government of Iraq. Lieutenant Colonel Keir-Kevin Curry said: \\\"No precise dates have been set, but the plan is to accomplish this within the next two to three months.\\\"\\n\\nLt. Col. Barry Johnson, military spokesman, says \\\"Clearly there's a lot of emotion attached to Abu Ghraib. For Iraqis, it dates back a lot further than abuses committed by American soldiers, and it makes it a magnet for attacks.\\\"\\n\\nThe prison complex was a widely feared center for torture and execution under Saddam Hussein, and as many as 4,000 people were executed in the prison in 1984. The buildings at Abu Ghraib were originally built by British contractors in the 1960s.\\n\\nPictures of extensive detainee abuse in Abu Ghraib taken inside the prison in November 2003 had been released earlier this year. In January 2005, a United States Army court martial proceeding found Army Spc. Charles Graner guilty of abusing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison. The jury sentenced Graner to ten years in prison. A total of nine other American soldiers were found guilty in allegations stemming from the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal.\",\"British sailors detained by Iran \\\"to be tried for espionage\\\"\\n\\nSunday, March 25, 2007\\n\\nThe Australian has reported that an internet website \\\"run by associates of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\\" states that the 15 British sailors who were arrested by Iranian Revolutionary Guards could face charges of espionage.

Agreement was reached on the so called Bali roadmap, but opinions differed on the substance of this and other documents that were decided upon. The Roadmap establishes the target year of  and the scope for a post- climate change agreement. This agreement is expected to include the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, amongst other things. While the EU had wished for the inclusion of a guideline range of -% for GHG emission cuts by industrialized nations by , this had been opposed by the US and others, and so was not included in the final \\\"roadmap\\\" which addresses all nations that are part of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). The range was however included in the preamble of the document agreed on by the members of the Kyoto Protocol. Bali Roadmap breakdown The \\\"Bali Roadmap\\\" document can be seen as having three distinct sections: The first is the preamble, which is non binding and is there to put the following decisions in context. This is where the guideline emissions cut range would have been. Still included is a reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year. It also recognizes that \\\"deep cuts in global emission will be required\\\" to avoid dangerous climate change. The second part is composed of a section calling for a \\\"shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions\\\" and then goes on with a description of the four \\\"building blocks\\\" envisioned for tackling climate change. These are mitigation adaptation technology development and transfer and financing The third and last part is the technical part of the document, with a proposed timetable for meetings and similar procedural matters being included. Current matters But it was not just the future that was talked about. There was also consensus on a number of current issues, such as the setting up of an expanded adaptation fund, and the necessity of accelerating the transfer and development of \\\"climate friendly\\\" technology. Opinions Perspectives on the outcome varied, with some non governmental organizations (NGOs) like Greenpeace International being generally happy that an agreement was achieved, but stating that a stronger mandate for the post  negotiations had been wished for, and that current issues were not all addressed satisfactorily either. The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon on the other hand welcomed the outcome of the conference, stating that all of his three benchmarks for success had been reached. He went on to say that he \\\"believes that the Bali Roadmap that has been agreed is a pivotal first step toward an agreement that can address the threat of climate change, the defining challenge of our time.\\\" The EU also welcomed the agreement that was reached, with Commission President Jos\\u00e9 Manuel Barroso noting that \\\"We have worked hard to achieve this result. It is a very important step forward.\\\" Both he and Stavros Dimas, European Commissioner for Environment, made it clear that Bali had only been the start of what needed to be done, with the later stating that \\\"Now the real hard work must begin. It is essential that the agreement to be worked out over the next two years is ambitious enough to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels.\\u201d\",\"One year on, London remembers \\u002f victims Friday, July ,  Londoners are commemorating the one year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on its transport networks that claimed  lives. On this day last year, a series of coordinated suicide bombings struck London's public transport system during the morning rush hour, with three bombs exploded within  seconds of each other on three London Underground trains. A fourth bomb exploded on a bus nearly an hour later in Tavistock Square. Fifty-two people were killed in the attacks, as were the four bombers, and about  injured in the deadliest single act of terrorism in the United Kingdom since the Lockerbie bombing in  and the deadliest bombing in London since the Second World War. The four suicide bombers were all UK residents, and while Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attacks, police are unsure of its exact role in the attack. Flowers were laid by mayor Ken Livingstone and Tessa Jowell, Secretary of State for Culture, near Kings Cross station at : a.m. BST ( UTC), marking the time and place of the first attack on a Piccadilly Line train beneath the station. Prime Minister Tony Blair, who attended a private memorial at London's Fire Brigade headquarters, said \\\"This is a time when our country unites across all races, religions and divides and stands in solidarity with all those who have suffered so much, in sympathy with them and in defence of the values which we share,\\\", and recalled the efforts of emergency and public service personnel and the public at large, in the aftermath of the attack. Tributes were also paid at Tavistock Square where a bus was attacked at : a.m. BST this day one year ago. The bells of St Paul's Cathedral tolled at the exact time of each of the bombings. A two minutes silence was held across the UK at noon BST ( UTC), including at the Wimbledon tennis tournament. In many schools, offices, shops and town centres across the country the two minutes was observed. Other events are planned around London for later in the day. Special programmes have been broadcast on British television to mark the occasion. Yesterday, a video of one of the bombers, Shehzad Tanweer, was broadcast on the Al-Jazeera television channel, claiming to link the attacks with Al-Qaeda.\",\"Tail from Air France jet recovered from Atlantic Ocean Monday, June ,  A search team from Brazil has recovered a part of the tail section of Air France Flight , which crashed in the Atlantic on June .

Meanwhile, France said that it has dispatched a nuclear submarine to search for the airplane's flight data recorders, which could provide information as to how and why the jet crashed. Sixteen bodies have been recovered from the waters of the ocean last weekend.

The February  earthquake and a subsequent tsunami completely destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street and its oldest villages. Wikinews has also had access to the original design plans of the new kiosks in Pichilemu, and conducted an interview with merchant Alejandro Mella, known locally as the King of the Cochayuyo (\\\"El Rey del Cochayuyo\\\"), who lost his kiosk after the earthquake. Pichilemu is a coastal city in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, known as one of the \\\"best surfing spots\\\" in South America. Its current Mayor is Roberto C\\u00f3rdova Carre\\u00f1o, who was elected internally by the Councillors of the city in September , after several political controversies that ended with three Mayors being displaced. The territory of Pichilemu has a surface of , square kilometers, and comprises at least  villages, such as Ciruelos, Rode\\u00edllo and Espinillo (the latter two also severely damaged by the March  earthquake). Pichilemu is the most popular beach in O'Higgins Region, and many tourists visit it every summer. 'The house moved from side to side. I really thought it was going to fall': First earthquake strikes The earthquake took place in what is considered the \\\"last weekend in the summer;\\\" on Saturday, February ,  at : local time (: UTC), while almost all Chileans were sleeping. Hours earlier, on Friday, thousands of people had arrived at Pichilemu. \\\"The house moved from side to side. I really thought it was going to fall. It was  or  minutes long,\\\" Diego Grez, a Chilean student who was in Pichilemu at the time of the quake, told Wikinews in an interview. A concert was being held at the One Discotheque when the earthquake occurred. It is said that the audience panicked and fled outside the discoth\\u00e8que, and then to the La Cruz Hill. Most tourists fled outside the city right after the earthquake occurred, but many others opted to stay in the La Cruz Hill or the village of Pueblo de Viudas, which are the higher points in the city. \\\"Pichilemu is the symbolic beach resort in the Sixth Region [of O'Higgins], so it was not strange to even think that [during] the last weekend before the entrance to school, many people would be going to take advantage of it to take a vacation; and that's what happened,\\\" reported El Rancag\\u00fcino, the most important newspaper in O'Higgins Region, on February . Agust\\u00edn Ross Balcony after the earthquake and tsunami. Image: Diego Grez. The only radio broadcasting in the area was Entre Olas, directed by Jorge Nasser, which also helped Pichileminians know what happened in other affected places by the earthquake, as they re-broadcasted the audio of Televisi\\u00f3n Nacional de Chile (National Television of Chile). On the day of the earthquake, the station reported that a local police truck had crashed near La Cruz Hill. There was no tsunami warning, and Mayor C\\u00f3rdova was away on holiday when the earthquake struck. \\\"Those who live in Pichilemu, and those who were visiting it, were surprised by the giant waves that annihilated its beach and reached the city's square, destroying everything on their way,\\\" reported El Morrocotudo on February . \\\"The most tough thing occurred when the firefighters' alarms sounded twice, and the people in the hill began to yell 'tsunami!',\\\" journalist Tania Arce told the newspaper. The earthquake destroyed one of Pichilemu's oldest and iconic buildings, the post office, which was demolished in July. The urban centre of Pichilemu was not severely damaged by the earthquake, but its subsequent tsunami caused most of the destruction. The Agust\\u00edn Ross architecture in the city (three of his buildings are National Monuments of Chile) was damaged. Agust\\u00edn Ross Balcony was completely destroyed. 'It's something unforgettable to me, I'm proud I saved all of those lives' According to SHOA, the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy, the tsunami triggered by the earthquake first reached Pichilemu, at : (: UTC). A second wave came at : (: UTC). Policeman Jos\\u00e9 Ar\\u00e9valo was the only person to warn residents that a tsunami was approaching. Ar\\u00e9valo was patrolling the Las Terrazas beach, when the earthquake occurred. He told El Rancahuaso there were around  people in the beach. \\\"Right after the quake, he noticed the sea had shrank around  meters inside. He took his megaphone, and shouted people should leave the place instantly.\\\" \\\"The sea is coming out! The sea is coming out!,\\\" he shouted. \\\"The warning was also preceived by nightclubs and pubs surrounding the costanera. Then, the tragedy occurred. The sea destroyed everything on its way,\\\" El Rancahuaso reported. \\\"It all was really quick. Everyone is safe, luckily [..] It's something unforgettable to me, I'm proud I saved all of those lives,\\\" Ar\\u00e9valo added. The tsunami destroyed restaurants, hotels, kiosks, the Fishermen Store (Caleta de Pescadores), surf schools, the Agust\\u00edn Ross Balcony (located right in front of the Las Terrazas beach) and houses near the costanera (the nearest street to the beach), and flooded the building of the Government of Cardenal Caro Province, the boarding school of Pichilemu, the city square (Arturo Prat Square), and the Supermarket El . A local worker, Ricardo Vivanco, also known as \\\"El Gordo\\\" (\\\"The Fat one\\\"), almost was killed by a tsunami, ignoring warnings by the Police and the Fire Bureau. Vivanco was drunk, and went down to the Las Terrazas beach with his friends. The wave washed him away, and was hit on the Agust\\u00edn Ross Balcony's wall. His friends recorded a video and uploaded it to YouTube. Damage in Punta de Lobos and villages It was reported by Radio Entre Olas on February , that the tsunami had provoked massive damage in Punta de Lobos, Pichilemu's most popular beach. The owner of Entre Mar, an hotel and restaurant in that beach, said the tsunami had destroyed all of his buildings there. The village of Espinillo was badly damaged, and approximately  people were made homeless by the earthquake, Teletrece reported on March . \\\"We are keeping the government informed, we're also organized with some churches [sic, religious organizations] that are working voluntarily in Espinillo, Los Boldos, Alto Ram\\u00edrez [...] We thank a lot their work, that is not to give them mediaguas [temporary tenements], but something definitive, but I also think they need resources to do it,\\\" Mayor C\\u00f3rdova said. 'We are here because we fear about our safety': Residents scramble after second earthquake On March , Chile was hit by a second earthquake, that reached a magnitude of ., and that occurred  kilometers southwest of Pichilemu. It occurred at : local time (: UTC), while the new President Sebasti\\u00e1n Pi\\u00f1era was sworn in. A tsunami warning was issued by SHOA, between Coquimbo and Los Lagos regions. People in Pichilemu fled again to La Cruz Hill. Military authorities assured people in the hill they were going to be safe there, and that it was unlikely a tsunami was going to hit again Chile's coast. The tsunami warning was lifted at : local time (: UTC). People stayed in La Cruz Hill for a longer time than after the previous earthquake, and several activities were made there, such as a concert by Chilean-Brazilian singer Joe Vasconcellos. People were also given food, wood (mostly remains from the destroyed kiosks), and electricity. \\\"We are here because we fear about our safety. We don't want it [a possible tsunami] to catch us. We have to settle down here and to accommodate,\\\" Edith Larra\\u00edn told to Wikinews. Mayor C\\u00f3rdova estimated that at least , people were staying at La Cruz Hill. Militaries and provincial authorities asked them to leave the hill on March , but most refused the deal. People eventually left the hill, due to complaints by the Mayor. Eight months on, reconstruction begins On March , in collaboration with the Governor of Cardenal Caro Julio Ibarra, Colonel Ra\\u00fal Melo, and the Mayor of Litueche Bernardo Cornejo, Mayor of Pichilemu Roberto C\\u00f3rdova announced a \\\"tourism revival campaign\\\" of Pichilemu, promoting the surf practice, whose goal was \\\"to make the city go back to the normality.\\\" On April , the first monument was erected in memory of the earthquake and tsunami victims. The monument was created by local artisans, with rocks from several places of the Cardenal Caro Province. \\\"We wanted to create this monument so we don't forget it [the earthquake] [...] This is the beginning of the reconstruction,\\\" said Julio Ibarra. The monument was placed in front of the beach, near the building of the Cardenal Caro Government. Mayor Roberto C\\u00f3rdova said that \\\"it definitely will help us reconstruct [ourselves] espiritually, [and that] is essential.\\\" On October , with the help of the Government, SERCOTEC (Technical Cooperation Service, Servicio de Cooperaci\\u00f3n T\\u00e9cnica) and FOSIS (Solidarity and Social Investment, Fondo de Solidaridad e Inversi\\u00f3n Social), the Fishermen Store (Caleta de Pescadores) began to be reconstructed. Caleta de Pescadores is administered by the Independent Labour Union of Fishermen of Pichilemu (Sindicato de Trabajo Independientes de Pescadores Artesanales), which has twenty-three members. \\\"The Government of President Sebasti\\u00e1n Pi\\u00f1era has been worried about the fishing area, carrying out several actions in help of them, after all that they've suffered after the earthquake and tsunami that hit them [...] This area is working normally again,\\\" Governor Ibarra said. New kiosks; interview with Alejandro Mella Alejandro Mella. Image: Diego Grez. On October , the Municipality of Pichilemu published the design of kiosks that were going to be constructed, as replacement of those destroyed by the earthquake. As of October , four kiosks have been constructed in Pichilemu, specifically on Las Terrazas beach, and two more are being constructed. According to Mauricio Grez, a construction engineer, the construction of one kiosk would cost up to US$ , (CLP ,,). Alejandro Mella, locally known as \\\"el Rey del Cochayuyo\\\" (\\\"the King of the Cochayuyo\\\"), is a merchant of Pichilemu, who promotes the cochayuyo (durvillaea antarctica), and lost his kiosk after the February earthquake and tsunami. \\\"I was given my [former] kiosk by the Mayor Orlando Cornejo, back in . It was right in front of us [in front of Las Terrazas beach, near \\\"the grotto of the Virgin\\\"], and was made smithereens by the tsunami,\\\" he told Wikinews. \\\"I have always worked on selling cochayuyo here, and the terrain where my kiosk was located before has been disputed by private people, and the municipality approved that. I talked with the Mayor and he said 'I don't know what's going on the beach'; that left me perplexed. [...] I like the new design of the kiosks, they are larger, and we can do more things with it, but they are way too expensive,\\\" he added. Mr. Mella also gave Wikinews a sample of his work as \\\"the King of the Cochayuyo\\\", an essay called \\\"El cochayuyo es una mina repleta de nutrientes y sales minerales\\\" (\\\"Cochayuyo is a mine full of nutrients and mineral salts\\\", pictured below), which he sells for  Chilean pesos (.

The program also alleged that prisoners at Abu Ghraib had been killed when U.S. soldiers ran out of rubber bullets as they tried to handle a jail riot, and started to use live rounds. Executive producer Mike Carey said Dateline had obtained a file containing hundreds of pictures, some known and others that show new abuses. However, he declined to say how the pictures came into their possession. Some pictures appear to show U.S. soldier Charles Graner who had a leading role in the earlier Abu Ghraib abuse scandal. Many of the new images are more graphic than those previously published - these new photos include prisoners performing sex acts and wounded\\u002fdead prisoners. SBS alleged the photographs of the dead bodies were of people who had died at Abu Ghraib during interrogation. The Guardian cites an unnamed US defense official saying that the Army had reviewed the pictures posted by SBS and confirmed that they were among those that are subject to the Freedom of Information Act request made by the ACLU. The American Civil Liberties Union has been granted access to pictures in possession of the army that had not been publicly released by a U.S. federal court in September, but the U.S. government appealed the decision.

Senior delegates are hopeful an international agreement will be reached on how to control harmful climate emissions when the Kyoto Protocol expires in , but environmental activists fear the talking is taking too long. Delegates in Bali hope to begin drafting a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to contain rising global temperatures. Many scientists believe the emissions contribute to a rise in global temperatures. Yvo de Boer, the United Nations' climate change chief, told reporters Friday that over the past two days, the mood at negotiations has been positive. Asked to provided a concrete example of progress, he said a special working group of delegates has agreed that any future agreement should include ways to encourage countries such as China and India to develop environmentally friendly practices as their industries and economies grow. \\\"So they've gone into an in-depth discussion on mitigation, and have come to the conclusion that really a strong focus needs to be on putting in place incentives for developing countries to mitigate climate change. That came up very strongly. That, to me at least, is a good indication that the mood is good, people are at work,\\\" said de Boer. But environmentalists have not been as optimistic about progress in this week's negotiations. Also today the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior arrived in Bali. Earlier this week, Japan took a position similar to the United States in proposing that any new agreement should favor voluntary emissions targets instead of mandatory ones. The two nations believe that binding emissions caps would threaten the economic growth needed to fund technology used to fight global warming. Hans Verlome, director of the World Wildlife Fund's Climate Change Program, urged the U.S., Japan and others to take more decisive action in light of a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that found global warming is occurring and is likely caused by humans. \\\"We did not come to Bali to just have another process, and we have two years of talks. It is time to get on with it,\\\" said Verlome. \\\"The IPCC report has delivered the results that are necessary to inform decision making, and the decision making is here, now.\\\" Verlome and other environmentalists say China has taken a leading role in negotiations this week. China wants wealthy countries to help spread technology for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in poor countries. Harlan Watson of the U.S. delegation reaffirmed his country's opposition to mandatory caps on carbon emissions, but said the U.S. would be open and flexible. \\\"The U.S. is committed to advancing negotiations, and developing a Bali roadmap, that will guide negotiations on a new post- global climate change regime that is environmentally effective and economically sustainable,\\\" he said.

Thousands of people are feared to have been killed by the tremors, which were felt as far away as Venezuela. Witnesses say bodies were lining the streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, after the quake struck on Tuesday afternoon, sending a cloud of dust from falling buildings into the sky. The quake was centered about sixteen kilometers from the capital, and struck at a depth of just ten kilometers, exacerbating the damage. At least  aftershocks were also recorded, the strongest of which came in at . and . magnitude. A tsunami alert was initially issued following the tremor, but it was retracted shortly afterwards. Buildings across the capital have collapsed, including the presidential palace and the headquarters of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti. However, the president, Ren\\u00e9 Pr\\u00e9val, and his wife reportedly survived the collapse of the building. The country's envoy to the United States believed damage costs could reach billions of dollars. UN peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said many people were in the UN building when it went down and they remain unaccounted for. A Brazilian military official later said four Brazilian soldiers who were part of the UN mission were killed. UN Peacekeeping Chief Alain LeRoy said the organisation is working to learn the fate of its personnel. \\\"As we speak there are still over  people unaccounted for under the rubble. We do not know about their fate [...] some people have been extracted out of the building - but only less than  for the time being. Some dead, some alive. So we do not know for the time being the fate of the others. But of course, we are extremely, extremely concerned.\\\" The Notre Dame of the Assumption Cathedral in Port-au-Prince was also destroyed, killing Joseph Serge Miot, the Archbishop of Port-au-Prince. \\\"[...] It would appear that all those who were in the building, including my friend [UN mission head] Hedi Annabi [...] and all those who were with him and around him are dead,\\\" said French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. In a statement released yesterday, the UN remarked that \\\"[f]or the moment, a large number of personnel remain unaccounted for.\\\" 'Total chaos' Hospitals in Port-au-Prince were reported to have collapsed, raising fears that the injured would not be able to receive treatment easily. \\\"We have reports of some of the most important hospitals in Port-au-Prince have been severely impacted by the earthquake,\\\" said Paul Conneally, the Head of Media for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \\\"I saw dead bodies, people are screaming, they are on the street panicking, people are hurt. There are a lot of wounded, broken heads, broken arms,\\\" recounted Raphaelle Chenet, the administrator of the Mercy and Sharing charity, in a telephone interview with the Wall Street Journal from the Haitian capital. UN officials reported that communications and power are out across the city, making it difficult to get accurate details regarding the full extent of casualties and damage. The UN also noted that the main prison in Port-au-Prince collapsed, and there were reports of inmates escaping. Spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs, however, said she had no further details about that. Efstathios Daras, the Greek ambassador to Venezuela who also represents Greece in Haiti, described the situation. \\\"We fear major loss of life, maybe in the thousands or tens of thousands.

The international aid agency added that there is an urgent need for search and rescue volunteers as well as field hospitals, emergency health, water purification and telecommunications. The World Food Program (WFP), which has a large staff on the ground, says the level of destruction indicates many of these people have been affected and will require help. The Director of the WFP office in Geneva, Charles Vincent, remarked that the first priority is to save lives. \\\"To rescue people that are buried, that are trapped, etc. [...] followed very rapidly by a big problem of water, sanitation, epidemic-problems of diseases that might be bred in that kind of situation,\\\" he noted. The Haitian ambassador to the United States, Raymond Joseph, told CNN the Caribbean nation is seeking US assistance, and called the quake a catastrophe of major proportions. \\\"I'm quite sure we're going to face a disaster of major proportion,\\\" he said. Separately, the Inter-American Development Bank said it will immediately approve a $, grant for emergency assistance to Haiti. The funds will be used to provide food, water, medicine and temporary shelter for victims of the massive quake. The US Agency for International Development is dispatching a disaster assistance response team to Haiti and commented that it will continue to provide additional support as needed. The UN, meanwhile, dispatched approximately  search and rescue teams to assist Haitians from a global network. UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon said that US$ million worth of emergency funds would be used. \\\"I have spoken with Mr. Clinton and we have agreed to mobilize our best assistance and rescue teams and try to reconstruct the Haitian economy. The UN will do whatever possible to help the Haitian people to overcome these difficulties,\\\" Ban stated. Ban noted that , UN peacekeepers were in Haiti, and that they secured the seaport and airport. They are trying to rescue people buried underneath rubble, he said, but were severely hampered by lack of heavy equipment. \\\"Brazilian forces have been working through the night to rescue but because of the darkness and destruction of infrastructure not much progress has been made. We hope it will be better this morning,\\\" Ban said. The aid group Oxfam added that its emergency response team for Latin America is based in Haiti and is well prepared, with a public health, water and sanitation team in Port-au-Prince. Oxfam says it is preparing to send in emergency supplies as soon as possible from Panama. The American Red Cross pledged US$, to help the country, and would send out people to assess damage. \\\"As with most earthquakes, we expect to see immediate needs for food, water, temporary shelter, medical services and emotional support,\\\" it said yesterday evening in a statement. A number of other nations, including the UK and Venezuela, are also planning to send aid. A reporter for the Al Jazeera news agency, however, said there might be difficulties delivering aid. \\\"We are about 300km from the epicentre of the earthquake, and we know that the UN agencies and the humanitarian groups here are trying to get together some kind of strategy to get aid over to Haiti. We know that there are trucks loaded with supplies ready to go but the difficulty is that no-one really knows how to get that aid to the people [effectively].\\\" This quake is said to have been the strongest in Haiti in over two hundred years; the last time an earthquake of comparable magnitude was recorded was in . Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country. Recent development efforts have suffered severe setbacks because of political violence, crime, corruption and natural disasters.

The Airbus A330 jetliner crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June, killing all  people on board. Chief executive Thomas Enders said in a statement, \\\"We want to know what happened, as improving air safety is our top priority. We are fully committed to support the extension of the search with a significant contribution.\\\" Although airframers normally supply technical assistance to investigations, the required impartiality makes funding rare, with Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath saying the company's move was unprecedented. \\\"This is an exceptional accident and an exceptional situation,\\\" Schaffrath explained. France's investigative agency BEA has requested financial assistance for the search from both Airbus and Air France. Air France have discussed this possibility with the BEA. Investigators have already given up looking for the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder using the conventional method of tracing audio 'pingers', the batteries of which would have expired after \\u2013 days. Efforts are ongoing using sensitive equipment under tow from a French naval vessel, but if this search proves fruitless then the BEA will seek money for a further three-month search. The jet's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was able to transmit information regarding problems on board prior to the crash. The ACARS data suggests that the plane had suffered from a loss of valuable readings including airspeed, leading suspicion to fall on the pitot-static system which supplies various measurements. Airbus had already recommended that one component of this system, the pitot tubes, be replaced on A330s. Air France had not done this on the accident airplane although the entire fleet now features the modified design. Three other incidents have been identified since that may involve similar circumstances. The United States National Transportation Safety Board is probing two over American soil while earlier this month another Air France A330 equipped with the new tubes suffered a similar series of problems enroute from Italy to France.\",\"Aid pledges rise; Japan promises ,, USD Saturday, January ,  In an abrupt about-face, the world's wealthiest nations have begun pouring funding into the Earthquake\\u002fTsunami damaged region.

Their claimed intention was to move the quake victims to a temporary orphanage being set up at a hotel-resort in the neighbouring Dominican Republic. Police said the Americans did not have paperwork, nor permissions, to remove the children from the country. If convicted the Americans could face prison terms of up to fifteen years. Reuters reported that all ten acknowledged they had violated the law when they tried to take the children from Haiti, but denied they were aware of this breach of law until after their detention. Haiti's justice minister, Paul Denis, stated he saw no reason why the missionaries should be tried in the US. \\\"It is Haitian law that has been violated,\\\" he told AFP. \\\"It is up to the Haitian authorities to hear and judge the case.

Newspapers reported on September  that no private cars would be allowed near any of the venues in the host city, in an attempt to combat the gridlock that has plagued the city. Known for its stand-still traffic, Beijing's transport authority believes it needs to curb at least % of traffic flow to ensure the Games run smoothly. The number of cars in the city is set to increase from . million to  million by the time of the Olympics. Country-wide, annual car sales are expected to reach  million annually by . A good infrastructure is one of the International Olympic Committee's top priorities when searching for bid cities. The IOC requires that athletes, support staff such as coaches, venue volunteers, spectators, and the press all should be able to get from venue to venue without hassle. Existing plans in Beijing say that private cars may only drive in the city on alternate days. Plates with odd numbers would drive one day, while even numbered licenses would drive the next day. Wired magazine has suggested fuel-cell vehicles may be China's next cultural revolution.

The first report, by Lieutenant General Sir Rob Fulton, looked at \\\"operational circumstances, consequences, and implications of the detention of the personnel\\\". The second, by Tony Hall, former BBC Director of News and now Chief Executive of the Royal Opera House, examined the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) handling of the media attention in relation to the incident and has been published on the MOD website. The report by General Fulton is not available to the public, as it is classified because it deals with operational issues. General Fulton identified weaknesses in training, communications and the handling of intelligence and suggested improvements in training for boarding operations. The Hall report found that the poor judgement in allowing members of the armed forces to talk to the media was not the failure of a single individual, but Defence Secretary Des Browne accepted this as his responsibility, and has apologised for this error. He said that personnel would not be allowed to sell their stories in future. In a statement to Parliament, Des Browne said that the Ministry of Defence were committed to implementing the recommendations made in the reports and that he expects \\\"the great majority to be implemented by the end of this year\\\".\",\"EU may see no reason to go to next major emitters meeting Thursday, December ,  Stavros Dimas at a press conference today stated that the European Union would not view it as necessary to attend the major emitters meeting (MEM) if no substantial agreement was reached at the climate change conference in Bali. His statement was made after being asked about rumours of the EU boycotting the US held MEM. He said that he had mentioned the preceding point of view in the presence of an under-secretary of the US government at a business breakfast this morning. He answered to a later question that he felt disappointed at the current stance of the US government, and wished clarity for the moment. According to a press release by Greenpeace, the German environmental minister Sigmar Gabriel also declared to the press that the EU would not be taking part in the scheduled MEM in January if substantial progress was not made. Amongst other points that are currently being discussed, one which is often referred to is that of whether or not a guideline frame for emissions reductions is to be included in the preamble of one of the final documents. The proposed frame is -% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized nations (known as Annex I nations in UNFCCC parlance), from  baselines. The US is amongst the relatively small number of nations, including Canada and Japan, that are opposed to this. Asked what he knew of the matter at an earlier press conference, Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC stated that Stavros Dimas, the European Commissioner for the Environment, had voiced his opinion that if no agreement is reached now, than there would be no need for the Major Emitting nations meeting to be held, because, so he apparently stated, the MEM is meant to feed into the UN process, and you could not feed something into nothing. The talks being held in Bali are expected to lead to a roadmap for negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions caps for after , which is when the current first phase of the Kyoto protocol is going to run out. Multiple parties, observers, and the top UN executive of the Climate Change branch all had expressed their hope that this roadmap would also include a target date of  for the conclusion of negotiations. The major emitters meeting is a convention of those nations that have the greatest greenhouse gas emissions, and was held for the first time at the invitation of the US in Autumn this year.\",\"Dec.  Sumatra quake was longest ever recorded Thursday, May ,  According to new information about the earthquake of December , , it was the longest-lasting earthquake ever recorded. \\\"Normally, a small earthquake might last less than a second; a moderate sized earthquake might last a few seconds. This earthquake lasted between  and  seconds (about  minutes),\\\" said Charles Ammon, associate professor of geosciences at Penn State University. \\\"Globally, this earthquake was large enough to basically vibrate the whole planet as much as half an inch, or a centimeter. Everywhere we had instruments, we could see motions,\\\" Ammon continued. This quake released an amount of energy equal to a  gigaton bomb, according to Roger Bilham, professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado. And that power lasted longer than any quake ever recorded. \\u201cNo point on Earth remained undisturbed,\\u201d said Bilham. The quake was centered in the Indian Ocean, and it created the biggest gash in the Earth's seabed ever observed. It measured nearly  miles, about the distance from northern California to southern Canada. Scientists have upgraded the magnitude of the quake from . to around .-., which is a dramatically more powerful quake. \\\"Two hours after the earthquake has occurred, the wave is spreading out from the Bay of Bengal,\\\" Thorne Lay, professor of earth sciences and director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz said. \\\"Two satellites went over, with the capability of measuring the elevation of the ocean surface. It was just good luck that the passage of the satellites caught the tsunami in motion. There will be more earthquakes of this type, and with more humans exposed to the hazard there will be more devastating losses of life. What we hope to do is develop technologies that can minimize that loss.\\\". Findings reported in the various papers: * In Sri Lanka, more than , kilometres from the epicenter, the ground moved nearly  centimetres. * The rupture spread from south to north. Seismometers in Russia recorded the quake at a higher frequency because it was moving toward them, while those in Australia measured a lower frequency as it moved away. * When the surface waves from the Sumatra quake reached Alaska they triggered a swarm of  earthquakes in the Mount Wrangell area.\",\"Romanian artists auction off their works for tsunami victims Thursday, January ,  Several prominent Romanian artists and celebrities will gather at the Radio Hall in Bucharest on Sunday, January , to raise money for the victims of the catastrophic Indian Ocean tsunami of December , . In an event titled Romanian Artists in Support of Asia, organised by The Reporter Foundation of Romania, artists will auction off their works, as well as personal objects, with all proceeds being donated to the relief efforts for the tsunami victims. Media celebrities such as the soprano Felicia Filip and singers Angela Similea and Dida Dragan will also be participating, as well as Maia Morgenstern, known internationally for her role in the film The Passion of the Christ. All ambassadors accredited in Bucharest, as well as political personalities, have been invited to participate. Romanian Artists in Support of Asia is the second major public event organised in Romania to support the victims of the recent Indian Ocean disaster. On Sunday, January , the Romanian public raised the equivalent of , euro in a telethon, while the Romanian Government pledged , euro for the relief effort.

According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, no tsunami warning was issued, contradicting some media reports that said there was one in place. The quake's magnitude was revised down from an initial report of . on the Richter scale. \\\"A destructive widespread tsunami threat does not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data,\\\" the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. \\\"However, there is the possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a  km [ miles] from the earthquake epicentre.\\\" The USGS reports that the epicentre was fifteen kilometres (ten miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince and , kilometers ( miles) southeast of Miami, Florida, at a depth of ten kilometres. According to USGS analyst Dale Grant, this tremor was \\\"the largest quake recorded in this area\\\"; the last strong quake was in , and had a magnitude of ., he noted. \\\"Everybody is just totally, totally freaked out and shaken. The sky is just gray with dust,\\\" said Henry Bahn, an official with the US Department of Agriculture who was visiting in Haiti and a witness to the incident. \\\"I just held on and bounced across the wall. I just hear a tremendous amount of noise and shouting and screaming in the distance,\\\" he commented, as quoted by the Associated Press. A map indicating the intensity of the earthquake in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, made by USGS According to data from the USGS, there were thirteen aftershocks after the initial tremors, the strongest of which was . on the Richter scale; seven others measured in at . or higher \\u2013 all the aftershocks were . or greater. No deaths have yet been reported, but a hospital in Port-au-Prince was damaged, and a US government official said several houses fell into a ravine. An analyst for USGS in Colorado commented that there could be many deaths from an earthquake of this strength. \\\"I think we are going to see substantial damage and casualties,\\\" he said. The USGS's Mike Blanpied remarked that about three million people were impacted by the earthquake, given its location. \\\"This quake occurred under land as opposed to off-shore, so a lot of people were directly exposed to the shaking coming off that earthquake fault, which was quite shallow,\\\" he said. A lack of communications makes it difficult to ascertain what damage was done. US embassy personnel were \\\"literally in the dark\\\" due to power failures, said State Department spokesman P. J. Crowley. \\\"They reported structures down. They reported a lot of walls down. They did see a number of bodies in the street and on the sidewalk that had been hit by debris. So clearly, there's going to be serious loss of life in this,\\\" he said, as quoted by AP.

Ahmadinejad met with the detainees shortly after a press conference where he announced that the release will be immediate, and that they will be taken to the airport. Cquote1.svg On the occasion of the birth anniversary of the great prophet of Islam, and on the occasion of Easter and Passover, I would like to announce that the great nation of Iran, while it is entitled to put the British military personnel on trial, has pardoned these  sailors and gives their release to the people of Britain as a gift. Speaking at a press conference that marked the end of Sizdah Bedar, Ahmadinejad said the British soldiers had violated Iranian territory and praised the southwest coast guards for capturing them. He presented their commander, Captain Abol-Ghassem Amangah, with Iran's third degree medal of courage. The President went on to accuse the British government of not being \\\"brave enough to tell their people the truth\\\" about the incident during the  days after their detention. He added that he was \\\"asking Mr Blair to not put these  personnel on trial because they admitted they came to Iranian territorial water,\\\", apparently trying to imply that the British servicemen were on a secret mission into Iranian waters, and should not have \\\"confessed\\\" on television to being in Iranian waters. The British government claims that the confessions were extracted under duress. The United Kingdom has maintained that the captured sailors and marines were in Iraqi territorial waters under a United Nations mandate and has called for them to be released. The President said that he had issued the order for release on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Prophet Mohammed, Mawlid an-Nabi, and on the occasion of Easter and Passover. Iranian media said that the British sailors 'shouted for joy' at the news. The President said that \\\"[After this meeting] they are free. They can go to the airport and they can go to their families\\\".\",\"Royal Navy sailors captured at gunpoint by Iranian guards Friday, March ,  Fifteen British Royal Navy personnel have been captured by Iranian authorities at gunpoint in the Persian Gulf off the Iraqi coast, according to the British Ministry of Defence. The Royal Navy insists that they were operating in Iraqi waters. The Iranian government initially gave the location of the incident as being inside Iraqi waters. After comments from the UK government, Iran gave a revised position for the incident, and the new position provided by the Iranians was outside Iraqi waters and within Iranian territorial waters. The Iranian government then stated that it was not the first time that British ships had entered Iranian waters. The sailors and marines, from the Type  frigate HMS Cornwall, had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution , a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection. HMS Cornwall at Zeebrugge in . The incident occurred near the Shatt al-Arab (Arvandrud) waterway, which forms the southern border between Iran and Iraq. Territorial and navigational control over the waterway has been a constant source of friction between the two countries, helping spark the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. The Ministry of Defence said that the Royal Navy personnel had been \\\"engaged in routine boarding operations of merchant shipping in Iraqi territorial waters\\\" and had finished their search of the suspect vessel when they were surrounded by Iranian forces. An Iraqi fisherman (who wished to remain anonymous) said that he saw the incident take place in the Ras al-Beesha area near the northern entrance of the Persian Gulf. The British government has demanded the return of the servicemen. Margaret Beckett, the U.K.'s Foreign Secretary said, \\\"we sought a full explanation of what happened and left the Iranian authorities in no doubt that we expect immediate and safe return of our service personnel and boats.\\\" The Iranian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office to see the Permanent Secretary to the FCO (as the Foreign Secretary was away from London in her Parliamentary constituency at the time). The United States also called for the immediate release of the sailors, supporting the United Kingdom's demand. Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the United States Department of State, said \\\"we support the British demand for the safe return of their people and equipment.\\\" The United States also confirmed separately (as reported on the BBC Ten O'Clock News) that it believed the British sailors had been in Iraqi waters. \\\"This is not the first time that British military personnel during the occupation of Iraq have entered illegally into Iran's territorial waters. [The sailors have been] detained by Iran's border authorities for further investigation ... of the blatant aggression into Iranian territorial waters,\\\" said an Iranian foreign Ministry official according to the television station run by Iran's government. In June , three small vessels and eight Royal Navy personnel were detained by Iranian forces after they allegedly entered Iranian waters on the Shatt al-Arab river without permission. At the time, the story was broken when the capture was announced on state-run Iranian television. British officials only stated that they had \\\"lost contact\\\" with the boats, before confirming their detention. On that occasion the men were later released unharmed, but only after being paraded blindfolded on Iranian TV and made to apologise for their role in the incident. The equipment was not returned. The seizure took place on the eve of Saturday's expected vote on a UN Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Iran for refusing to end its uranium enrichment programme. Iran recently threatened to seize Coalition military personnel in response to what it claimed was an undercover operation by foreign security agencies to abduct senior officers in its Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Reza Faker, a writer believed to have links with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wrote in the Subhi Sadek (the Revolutionary Guard's weekly newspaper), \\u201cwe\\u2019ve got the ability to capture a nice bunch of blue-eyed blond-haired officers and feed them to our fighting cocks.

An Italian Tour de France commentator mentioned he had met Rasmussen in June on a training camp in Italy. It has been reported that the hotel, where Rabobank's team was staying, was raided and searched late Wednesday by the police. There is no word on whether the search turned up anything. Rasmussen had come under heavy fire for having received four warnings from cycling authorities before the race, because of him failing to inform about his whereabouts. Before today's stage, which he won, Rasmussen said: \\\"I want to make absolutely clear I've had out-of-competition tests prior to the Tour de France,  tests during the Tour and all the results are negative ...

The acting head of the UN's Haitian mission, meanwhile, says that that full reconstruction could take several decades. As many as , people were killed by the tremors, which struck on January , and . million people have been left without homes. Anthony Banbury, the deputy head of the UN mission in the earthquake-ravaged country, commented to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency that survivors queuing for aid sometimes turned violent. He commented that while the aid is vital for the country, \\\"it can be a source of insecurity because it attracts big crowds and there can be disorder around food distribution.\\\" \\\"[It is] absolutely necessary that we get enough food, enough water, enough shelter for the people, and enough security. I don't think any of us are anywhere near being close to being satisfied, because so much more needs to be done,\\\" he added. \\\"[We must] do things smart, as well as fast, and that's a big challenge for us now.\\\" The Haitian national police chief, Mario Andresol, remarked that electricity blackouts resulted in \\\"bandits [...] taking advantage to harass and rape women and young girls under the tents,\\\" adding that , inmates of prisons escaped after the quake. \\\"It took us five years to apprehend them. Today they are running wild.\\\" Further exacerbating the security situation was that the Haitian police force was largely crippled by the disaster, with hundreds of policemen either killed or missing. \\\"At night, people take things. But I don't have a problem. I don't have anything to steal.\\\" said one local resident, Omen Cola, to AFP. Child trafficking, meanwhile, is also an issue; it had been a chronic problem even before the earthquake. The Red Cross has started to register orphaned children, and temporarily sending some to orphanages for shelter, according to a senior advisor for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Bo Viktor Nylund. UNICEF press official Roshan Khadivi told the Xinhua news agency on Wednesday that \\\"we are taking photos and filling in forms to get the children's full details on file. Experience has shown us that there is at least one family member left usually. UNICEF does not believe in institutionalization in orphanages. Children need to be connected with their communities.\\\" Khadivi noted that considering adoption would only be done if the child's parents are not found after several months. Sixty orphaned children, meanwhile, were transported earlier by plane to Germany, where they are to be adopted; six of them were hospitalised for fatigue and dehydration. \\\"Starting below zero\\\"; rescue efforts continue Edmond Mulet, the acting head of the UN mission for Haiti, told the BBC that it could take decades to fully reconstruct the country, and any recent development had been negated by the quake. \\\"I think this is going to take many more decades than only ten years, and this is an enormous backwards step in Haiti's development. We will not have to start from zero but from below zero,\\\" he said. Mulet, who is also the UN's assistant peacekeeping operations secretary-general, said that the aid logistics were a \\\"nightmare\\\". However, he said he believed the capacity to provide help was improving, saying: \\\"All this is coming together right now. Every day you can see more and more Haitian national police on the ground, working with our troops and more and more water being distributed, so it's a matter of time and putting all these elements together,\\\" as quoted by the BBC. According to the head, , heavy-duty tents had been ordered, to help people cope with the rainy season, which generally starts in May. \\\"Of course, , family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season - are not available in the market just like that, so they have to be made. It's going to take a few days and weeks before they can arrive, but all this is coming,\\\" Mulet noted. The Haitian president, Rene Preval, earlier this week asked for , tents and  million ready-to-eat meals to be airdropped. Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Ewing, commander of Canada's Disaster Assistance Response Team, meanwhile, was concerned whether there was enough management in relief operations. \\\"Everyone is trying to help, but it's not as coordinated as it should be. We're not getting aid to where it needs to go as effectively as it should be,\\\" he told AFP. Earlier this week, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, described the reconstruction process as being a \\\"colossal work of reconstruction.\\\" \\\"In  seconds, we lost nearly  percent of our gross domestic product, because all of Haiti's resources were concentrated in a small area around our seat of government,\\\" he said. \\\"We have to decentralise. It's the only way to be efficient. It's also the only way to avoid the same problems happening in Haiti again.\\\" The UN, meanwhile, reports that international funding and aid pledges for the country have now surpassed US$ billion worth.\",\"Footage of \\u002f bombers shown to court Thursday, May ,  The scenes after the bombings on July  A court in the United Kingdom has been shown footage of the bombers that attacked London on July , . The jury were told that the footage, taken by a CCTV camera, was taken just nine days before the bombings. The video was shown as part of the trials of Waheed Ali, Mohammed Shakil and Sadeer Saleem, who are charged with conspiracy to cause an explosion, because of their alleged involvement in the preparation of the bombings. Three of the July  bombers, Mohammed Siddique Khan, Shezhad Tanweer and Jermaine Lindsay, were shown in the video, although the other bomber, Hasib Hussain, was not seen in the video. The film was taken from a camera located at Luton railway station. Russell Square after the bombings. Image: Francis Tyers. The footage, which was shown to Kingston Crown Court was described by Teletext as 'chilling.' Last month a video showing Mohammad Siddique Khan saying goodbye to his child was shown in the court. In the video he explained his reasoning for his actions. \\\"And I'm doing what I'm doing for the sake of Islam, not, you know, it's not for materialistic or worldly benefits,\\\" he said, when talking to his six month old daughter. The defendants in the trial have previously been accused of helping to find locations for further bombings. The July  bombings were a series of coordinated bombings which struck London on the morning of July , .  people died and approximately  were injured as a result of the bombings. When commenting on the defendants, Neil Flewitt QC claimed that \\\"it is the case that the defendants associated with and shared the beliefs and objectives of the London bombers.\\\"\",\"days of hard labor for Abu Ghraib dog handler Friday, June ,  Convicted on the first of June by a military jury for participating in prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, former sergeant Santos Cardona, , a dog handler in the United States Army, was today sentenced to ninety days of hard labour and demoted to the rank of specialist. Cardona was charged and convicted on two counts: aggravated assault, for using a Belgian shepherd dog to threaten detainees with actions \\\"likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm,\\\" and for dereliction of duty in relation to this act. He was cleared of seven other charges. Cardona faced up to three and a half years in prison on these charges, and despite the conviction his attourney has expressed relief at the sentence. He will not be held in confinement during the term of his sentence.\",\"False dawn for Air France flight; debris not from crash, search continues Friday, June ,  Teams from France and Brazil have confirmed that neither have recovered any debris from Air France Flight . The Airbus A330 with  on board vanished from radar on June 1st over the Atlantic Ocean. The Brazilian Air Force had previously released a statement on June  saying debris from the lost jet had been found. A wooden cargo pallet and two buoys had been recovered, but are now believed to have been from a ship. The flight was carrying no wooden pallets. On June , it was reported, and previously confirmed by the Brazilian Air Force, that one seat and a life vest were found floating in the water. A fuel slick also thought to be from the plane, has also been confirmed to have come from another source, most likely a ship. The presence of fuel was used as evidence to suggest there had been no fire or explosion on board. Spanish paper El Mundo has quoted an Air Comet pilot flying over the Atlantic at the time as saying he witnessed \\\"an intense burst of white light\\\" falling out of the sky and breaking apart. A bomb threat, which later turned out to be \\\"false\\\", was also reported on a separate Air France flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Paris on May , just days before Fight  went missing. The French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) is leading the investigation, and has so far established that there were thunderstorms in the area and a series of automated signals from the plane indicated an inconsistent speed and a string of systems failures. At : p.m. the autopilot disengaged and at least one computer switched to an alternative power source. There was an indication that flight control systems had sustained damage, and this was followed by the failure of speed, heading and altitude indicators as well as flight control systems, while control systems for the central computer system and wing spoilers also failed. Four minutes after the problems began the last message indicated total electrical failure and a loss of cabin pressure. French armed forces spokesman Christophe Prazuck commented that \\\"Everyone has doubts about everything at the moment and we do not have the slightest beginnings of an answer yet.\\\" French paper Le Monde commented that the aircraft's speed was too low, prompting the BEA to warn against \\\"hasty interpretation or speculation\\\" in regards to the cause. Airbus have reminded all A330 operators of correct operating procedures in extreme weather conditions. France has sent the research ship Pourquoi Pas? to the scene and the vessel is currently en route with mini-submarines to assist in searching for and recovering debris. The search is still underway for the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, or black boxes. Brazilian officials previously said the boxes could be at the bottom of the ocean, between \\\", or , metres [, to , feet] in that area of the ocean.\\\"\",\"Human Rights Torch Relay Night held in Taiwan Friday, August ,  After the starting of \\\"Global Human Rights Torch Relay\\\" project in Athens, Greece, Epochtimes Taiwan and Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong in China (CIPFG) held \\\"Human Rights Torch Relay Night\\\" at  Memorial Park, Taipei City in the evening of August . In addition to musical performances, the evening show includes an impromptu opera and ending chorus to revealed the problem of human rights at PRC China. The \\\"Global Human Rights Torch Relay\\\" project was founded by over  people from many fields of expertise including politics, human rights, free culture, and medicine. Organized by CIPFG, more than  countries and  cities and counties echoed this project. This torch of hope symbolized protection of human rights and respect of human life, and also protested the  Olympics held in China without human rights and many unfair discrimination. The newly-elected Chairman of Taiwan Solidarity Union Kuen-hui Huang criticized Mainland China in oppressing human rights, and international status of Taiwan such as economic, sports, NPO\\u002fNGOs, and politics, that couldn't be accepted by many countries ruled by law. He also mentioned that Mainland China hold Olympic Games is surely a sarcasm. Also, a lawyer of CIPFG said that Mass Media in Taiwan didn't revealed the truth of oppressing human rights in Mainland China and also promoted Beijing  with \\\"We Are Ready\\\" slogan. If they still support Beijing  with those way above, Taiwan will be in a great crisis and no one can see the truth of Mainland China. After the evening declaration of the \\\"Global Human Rights Torch Relay\\\", CIPFG and Epochtimes Global will launch \\\"World Human Rights\\\" Web and still promote \\\"Global Human Rights Torch Relay\\\" for accepting registration of welcoming the Torch to Taiwan.\",\"Possible bodies, wreckage from Air France Flight  found Saturday, June ,  The Brazilian Air Force has located bodies and wreckage of Air France Flight  in the Atlantic Ocean. At least two bodies have been recovered so far.

Earlier this week the British government rejected calls for a Public Inquiry, arguing that such an investigation would be too expensive, take too long, and be a distraction from their efforts to combat terrorism. Instead, the government has offered to put together a \\\"narrative of events\\\". But survivors of the attack argue that a fully comprehensive investigation could teach valuable lessons which may help reduce the likelihood of future attacks, and improve the response capabilities of the emergency services. Some survivors, such as Rachel North (a pseudonym), who has been active in organising a support group for her fellow victims, have been angered by the government's alternative proposal of a \\\"narrative\\\". Writing on the weblog she started to help her, and others, come to terms with the aftermath of July 7th, Ms North says: \\\"Even if you don't like the questions, don't like the answers, think you know the answers already, Mr Blair, it is us, not you, who are paying the cost for this... If the cost of answering questions makes you squirm, then too bad... We run the risks on the trains, the buses, the streets each day... How dare you presume you know our questions and how dare you presume that they can be answered by a 'narrative of what happened', as if we are children to be placated with a story. I know what happened, I want to know why.\\\" Ms North also quotes a number of other survivors: \\\"We are constantly reminded that this is the worst peace time bombing London has ever seen, for something that bad there should be an inquiry. People died, families lost someone they loved and hundreds are still suffering. You can't put a price on that but apparently the government can.\\\" - \\\"Fiona\\\" \\\"If nothing else, an enquiry would make sure some of these lessons were learnt in case, God forbid, anything like this happened again. I thought there were plansin place for emergencies such as this. Whilst the emergency services did a fantastic job on the day, I have been stunningly underwhelmed by the support offered to victims since.\\\" - \\\"Pauline\\\" An anonymous survivor, writing on the \\\"Yorkshire lass\\\" website, says: \\\"'When I watched the Al-Qaeda video declaring Jihad against the UK I was haunted by the familiarity of the voice, it was my voice, my accent, my dialect. This is not a man who was recruited and trained in some far off country that I have barely heard of, this was a man who was recruited and trained while he lived  minutes from my mother's home where I was born and raised.The words he spoke of are words similar to what I have heard many times from disillusioned young men that I studied for my A Levels with. They are the words of hatred I overheard when I worked as a support worker at my local college. They were words of students who were educated... when someone follows through with the actions of those opinions to the detriment of others, questions need to be asked why preventions were not put in place and this needs to be done by public inquiry for peace of mind.I have been told that I am looking for justice in the wrong place and in some way that is right. However, I want some sort of justice, some manner of peace of mind, some questions answered and resolutions made. I don't want others to have to go through what myself and hundreds of other commuters did on that Summer's day.'\\\" Relatives of the dead have also been very critical. Quoted on the BBC's website, Saba Mozakka, the daughter of Behnaz Mozakka,who died in the Piccadilly Line explosion, said: \\\"The families will be campaigning for there to be a full public inquiry... A narrative of events will not satisfy anybody. This is not something we will go away on.\\\" Marie Fatayi-Williams, whose son Anthony was killed in the attack, told the BBC: \\\"I ask myself - if there is really nothing to hide then why shy away from a public inquiry? It is the only real way that we can truly get things discussed and see for ourselves what happened and what lessons can be learnt and whether we are better prepared now than on  July... I have a son who was killed and is never going to come back. Nobody is going to tell me that [an inquiry] is a waste of police time.\\\" The survivors' petition has so far gathered over  signatures. The British government has given no response as yet.\",\"Black boxes from Air France Flight  localized Thursday, May ,  Air France A330- F-GZCP lands at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport on March , .

The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, or \\\"black boxes\\\" from an Air France plane that crashed on June  last year in the Atlantic Ocean, have been localized to within about  square miles ( square kilometers), a French official said on Thursday. The French government and military officials have urged caution, saying there is no guarantee the flight recorders will be found. French navy spokesman Hugues du Plessis d'Argentre commented to AFP, \\\"[I]t's like trying to find a shoe box in an area the size of Paris, at a depth of ,000m (,800ft) and in a terrain as rugged as the Alps.\\\" The aircraft, an Airbus A330-, carrying  passengers and  crew members, for a total of  people on board, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean after flying in bad weather. The pitot tubes, which measure airspeed, are considered likely to have been a contributing factor to the crash. However, the actual cause has yet to be determined.

However, on May , the search was extended to May .\",\"Americans contribute to relief effort Friday, December ,  While complaints about the 'miserly' generosity of the Bush Administration have surfaced in recent days, donations and actions at the grassroots level have quietly illustrated the concern and sympathy felt by ordinary Americans. On Monday of this week, Jan Egeland, the UN's chief of emergency relief said that rich nations like the U.S. were being \\\"stingy\\\" by making small contributions. Egeland later recanted his statement, adding that America's contributions to Asia's tsunami relief was \\\"one of the most generous pledges so far.\\\" The Bush administration has pledged $ million in aid for the relief effort. Critics have been quick to compare this to the $ million spent every day in Iraq to conduct war in that country. In comparison, there was a $ million pledge made recently by the government of Japan.

The decision was made at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali. The Roadmap establishes a time frame and scope for reaching a post- climate change agreement. This includes setting, for industrialized nations, targets for reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous observers and parties had voiced that they see this as being of great importance prior to and during the conference. Following the reopening of the plenary at midday, India reiterated its position that part of a paragraph needed to be reformulated. The EU went on to state that in the spirit of negotiations, they agreed with the proposed changes. After some further statements by other nations, the US said that they can not accept the changes, as they would considerably change the balance of the text. This was met with loudly audible booing in the plenary. Some time later, after a number of other nations voiced their opinions and the American delegation could be seen busily debating and writing, the US said they would agree to the consensus position after all. Standing ovations and cheers welcomed this change in position, which allowed the President of the Conference soon thereafter to declare the document decided. India this morning had raised objections on one of the central documents of what constitutes the Roadmap. This had made a decision impossible for the time being, as the conference can only pass items unanimously. The objection regarded the phrasing of how nations with developing industries are to take action to slow and reduce their GHG emissions. The President of the Conference, the Indonesian Environmental Minister, had declined the request, stating that the proposal he had made was very finely balanced. The President had then suspended the session so that further consultations could be made. No progress was made when the meeting was reopened about an hour later, with China stating that negotiations of the so called Group of  and China with the Indonesian Minister of Finance were still ongoing. China then accused the UNFCCC secretariat of deliberately opening the plenary session at a time it knew that their Ministers were in talks. The Chinese delegate went on to demand an apology by the secretariat, and the meeting was again suspended. Yesterday's negotiations Ministerial negotiations had continued through the night until the early morning hours yesterday and the climate conference had been scheduled to decide on the last outstanding items this morning. Yesterday evening Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC had said that the parties were \\\"on the brink of agreement\\\", when he was asked where negotiations currently stand. With almost all open matters having been agreed on by a group of  ministers, one of the last outstanding points then was still the question of guideline numbers for GHG cuts. Some of the issues that had still been open the day before yesterday (for example how deforestation was to be addressed and the matter of financial support for developing countries to send and support negotiators to the UN climate conferences), had apparently been addressed to everyones satisfaction during yesterdays informal talks. But the talks were still on with regard to preambular text of a document that states how further action to mitigate climate change is to be taken, the inclusion of a -% range for reductions in GHG emissions for industrialized nations by  from  levels being contested. The draft decision proposed by the President of the Conference today however, no longer included the numbers, but did make reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year.\",\"Ties found between Abu Ghraib prison abuse and Guantanamo Bay Thursday, July ,  In testimony at a military hearing yesterday on abuses at the U.S. prison camp in Iraq, the former warden of Abu Ghraib, Maj. David Dinenna, said he attended in September  a meeting with Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, who was then commander of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp. Maj. Dinenna said Gen. Miller recommended using dogs, because of their effectiveness. Two dog handler soldiers at Abu Ghraib stand accused in the hearing. Sgt. Santos A. Cardona, , and Sgt. Michael J. Smith, , are alleged to have used the dogs to threaten and intimidate prisoners. During the defendants' testimony on Tuesday, they said the interrogation techniques used by them on prisoners was learned from a team of interrogators that was dispatched to Iraq from the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba. The Article  military court proceeding, which concluded Wednesday in Fort Meade, Maryland, is a preliminary hearing to hear prosecution and defense arguments in the case. The Prosecution is seeking a court-martial with claims that the defendants acted criminally. The Defense contends the soldiers were following orders, and that the charges should be dropped. The investigating officer of the military court, Maj. Glenn Simpkins, has two weeks to weigh the evidence that was presented. Some or all charges could be dropped, but if some charges stand, he will make a recommendation on how Sgts. Cardona and Smith should be dealt with when it goes to trial. The two accused said in yesterday\\u2019s testimony that Col. Thomas M. Pappas, the top military intelligence officer at Abu Ghraib, approved the use of the dogs. Testimony was also heard from Pvt. Ivan L. \\u201cChip\\u201d Frederick, now serving an -year sentence in Fort Leavenworth for his role as ringleader in the abuse, who testified by phone from prison that approval was given to use the dogs, and that a civilian interrogator was also sometimes involved in directing which prisoner cells were to be visited by dog handlers. In addition to the use of dogs, aggressive interrogation techniques such as clothing removal and sleep deprivation were also part of the series of abuses. Staff Sgt. James Vincent Lucas previously had told Army investigators in Guantanamo that he left Cuba in  to go to Iraq where he, as a member of a -man team, taught the \\u201clessons learned\\u201d at Guantanamo, and served to \\u201cprovide guidelines\\u201d to interrogators at Abu Ghraib. Legislation sponsored by several Senate Republicans seeks to specifically regulate the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo and other military prisons. A co-sponsor of the bill, Lindsey Graham (R-SC), recently released declassified internal memos dating from  and written by top military lawyers. They warned the Pentagon about the aggressive tactics at Guantanamo. The memos noted it would heighten the dangers for U.S. troops caught by the enemy. Army charge sheets accuse Cardona and Smith with maltreating detainees from November , , to January ,  by \\\"directing, encouraging, or permitting [their] unmuzzled military working dog[s] to bark and growl at detainees in order to unlawfully harass and threaten the detainees and in order to make the detainees urinate or defecate on themselves.\\\" Cardona, of Fullerton, with the 42nd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Bragg, N.C., was charged with nine counts. Smith, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with the 523rd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Riley, Kan., was charged with  counts.\",\"US General invokes right against self-incrimination in Abu Ghraib case Thursday, January ,  Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, a top US commander who supervised the detention and interrogation of detainees at Guantanomo Bay and Abu Ghraib facilities declined to testify in a court-martial proceeding, by invoking his right to not implicate himself, the Washington Post reports. This is believed to be the first time that the role of senior officers in the prisoner abuse scandal has formally surfaced. Gen. Miller declined to testify during the court-martial trial involving two dog-handlers who are accused of detainee abuse. An attorney for one of the accused is seeking to question Miller on whether he ordered the use of dogs to frighten detainees during interrogations. Gen. Miller's lawyer has stated that the decision to decline testifying was taken as Miller has been repeatedly interviewed over the last several years, and that he stands by his previous statements made to Congress, Army Investigators and lawyers.\",\"Climate Negotiations soon to conclude in Bali; UN \\\"concerned by the pace of things\\\" Thursday, December ,  After almost two weeks of negotiations, this years United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNCCC) is soon going to end, Friday being scheduled as the last day of the talks, with an extension until Saturday being possible if agreement can not be reached beforehand. While the head of the UNFCCC Secretariat, Yvo de Boer, stressed from the onset that actual targets for emission reductions were not to be expected to be agreed on, the inclusion of a target frame for industrialized nations is being debated after all. However, his stated goal of deciding on a roadmap for negotiations, which he said needed to address the matter of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reductions after , and would have to be concluded by , is not yet achieved, there being disagreement on a matter of points. China for example restated a position it had made at the beginning of the first week, calling for  as target year for the so called \\\"Bali Roadmap\\\". But a bigger point of contention is that the EU and the vast majority of the  nations participating in the conference want to set a target of a -% cut in GHG emissions. The U.S., along with Canada and Japan, are refusing to agree to any targets at this point. The EU and others say it is important to set targets now, to get a head start in the fight against global warming. The U.S. says targets should come later, after negotiations begin. The latest to be heard by Sean Heron, who is reporting on behalf of the Wikinews on site, regarding the ongoing negotiations was a statement by a Pakistani official, saying that the US had made a new proposal, and that he was feeling more optimistic than he had the day before. The official spoke in the press conference room, excusing the Ambassador Munir Akram, who was supposed to give a briefing on behalf of the Group of  and China, but couldn't make it, as negotiations, due also to the new American suggestion, were still ongoing at  pm local time.\",\"ETA places explosives on Tour de France route in Spain Wednesday, July ,  Authorities in Spain say that at least two explosive devices were found on a section of the Tour de France bicycle race just outside the Spanish town of Belagua. Authorities say that \\\"a small amount of explosives\\\", were placed inside plastic food containers then placed on both sides of the road. There are no reports of injuries but conflicting reports say that the cyclists passed the area before the devices went off, while others report that the devices were detonated before the cyclists passed. The Basque separatist group known as the ETA have claimed responsibility for placing the devices on the route. A telephone call was placed to authorities by someone claiming to be from the ETA who threatened to use the devices.\",\"Protests surround London Olympic torch relay Sunday, April ,  Around  arrests have been made by Metropolitan Police officers, during the  mile Olympic Torch relay in London, England. The torch relay began at Wembley Stadium where protesters waved flags and chanted as the torch started on its route. Protests then became more dramatic, as demonstrators attempted to extinguish the flame using a fire extinguisher, and grab the torch from the hands of TV presenter Konnie Huq in Ladbroke Grove. Both of the attempts were unsuccessful, and were prevented by police officers and members of the torch's security team. The torch continued its route, surrounded by more than twenty security officers, to be seen by hundreds of spectators, and also continued verbal protests by groups highlighting the human rights issues in China. There were also pro-China protesters present chanting slogans. It is believed that around  -  arrests have been made throughout the course of the day. The route ends at the O2 Arena after being carried by around  athletes, dignitaries and entertainers, including five time Olympic gold medal winner Sir Steve Redgrave.\",\"Olympic torch extinguished three times in Paris Monday, April ,  Today, the Olympic torch went out three times while traveling through Paris, France. Olympic officials claim that this came as a result of actions by Pro-Tibetan protesters. It has been reported that the torch was extinguished, then put on a bus to keep it safe. The torch was extinguished one time by a Chinese official when the torch was in the hands of David Douillet, and one time due to technical problems. Sylvain Garel, of the Green Party and member of the Paris City Council tried to catch the torch from bearer Stephane Diagana's hands. A ceremony on City Hall Plaza was canceled, \\\"by Chinese officials\\\" according to Paris' mayor Bertrand Delano\\u00eb. A banner with \\\"Paris defends human rights around the world\\\" was installed on the City Hall. Reporters without Borders, head of the protest in France, put a banner on the Eiffel Tower and on Notre-Dame de Paris by its Secretary-General Robert M\\u00e9nard. This action comes soon after the official news agency of China described the actions by the protesters as \\\"vile misdeeds\\\". A spokesman for Beijing  said \\u201cthe torch represents the Olympic spirit and people welcome the torch.\\u201d A spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee said that the IOC is concerned about the situation in Tibet, although they do not encourage people to disrupt the ceremonies. The spokesperson said \\\"The International Olympic Committee has expressed its serious concern and calls for a rapid peaceful resolution in Tibet.\\\" He did, however, say that the style of protesting was \\\"not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the Olympic Games\\\". The BBC has reported that  protesters were present in Paris today. Yesterday, protesters tried to grab and extinguish the torch in London, without success. The events were not broadcast live, as a Chinese Committee demanded to screen the footage prior to broadcast.\",\"Tour de France: Alexander Vinokourov wins stage  Saturday, July ,  Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan has won stage  of the  Tour de France. Vinokourov finished the  km individual time trial, centered around Albi, in a time of 1h ' \\\". Michael Rasmussen of Denmark held on to his overall lead, finishing 11th in the stage. Alejandro Valverde and Iban Mayo both lost ground in the overall. Cadel Evans gained ground on Rasmussen and is now just one minute behind. This stage provided the first shake-up in the standings in days. Valverde and Mayo, who were previously second and third, have dropped out of the top ten. Pre-Tour favorite, Vinokourov, was able to use his stage victory to return to the top ten for the first time since stage . Rasmussen did better than some expected. Afterwards he said: \\\"I thought I had a fair chance, but from thinking to doing that can be a long way. I was a bit in trouble in the first  km, but in the last  km I did very well.\\\" Just yesterday, Rasmussen was suspended by the Danish Cycling Federation because of a warning from anti-doping authorities within the Union Cycliste Internationale. There has not been a positive test, but the warning was issued for not keeping UCI informed of his whereabouts. \\\"I do admit I committed an administrative error,\\\" said Rasmussen. \\\"I have already received a warning from the UCI but I am very calm and very relaxed.\\\" He continued, \\\"I know a lot of riders who have received warnings for not giving updated information to the UCI. I'm just one out of many and it's just that I happen to have the yellow jersey.\\\" Tomorrow's stage will take the race into the Pyrenees. This stage starts with a category  climb out of Mazamet and then follows a relatively calm route via Carcassonne, Limoux and Quillan before taking on the Port de Pailh\\u00e8res ( km at .%) and a very difficult finish at Plateau-de-Beille ( km at .%).\",\"Five found guilty of UK bomb plot Tuesday, May ,  Five men were found guilty Monday for their part in an unsuccessful plot to carry out bombings in the UK. The five had been arrested in  in a police raid named Operation Crevice. Two other men arrested and charged at the time were found not guilty. The trial at the Old Bailey criminal court in London took place over the past year and had been carried out with little detail being released. It has now been revealed that the guilty had planned large fertiliser bombings of a nightclub, gas power plant and shopping mall. All five were found guilty of plotting to cause an explosion likely to endanger life and have been jailed with life sentences. The five convicted are Omar Khyam, , Waheed Mahmood, , and Jawad Akbar, , from Crawley, West Sussex, Salahuddin Amin, , from Luton, Bedfordshire and Anthony Garcia, , of Barkingside, east London. All of the men are British citizens. The two men found not guilty are Nabeel Hussain and Shujah Mahmood. During summations, the judge, Sir Michael Astill, criticised the guilty men for plotting against their country. \\\"You have betrayed this country that has given you every opportunity,\\\" said judge Astill. \\\"All of you may never be released. It's not a foregone conclusion.\\\" It was also revealed that some of the fertiliser bomb conspirators had met with two of the London subway bombers. Opposition parties have now called for an independent inquiry into the  July link. The details of the  July link had not been brought in front of the jury during the trial of the fertiliser bomb planners. A Canadian man, Momin Khawaja, was arrested in  and has been held in a Canadian jail ever since. He is accused of being a co-conspirator with five British plotters for allegedly developing bomb detonators. Khawaja is considered an un-indicted co-conspirator with relation to the British case. Khawaja is the first person to be held under the  Anti-Terrorism Act under Canada's Criminal Code, put in place by Canada's then Liberal government. Khawaja has been charged with seven offences under the new laws. \\\"He's been in custody for more than three years, facing these charges,\\\" said Lawrence Greenspon, Khawaja's lawyer. \\\"The (British) jury obviously had a great deal of difficulty coming to a decision,\\\" Greenspon told CTV News. \\\"Even with that, two of the seven were acquitted.\\\"\",\"Saskatchewan town asks for return of \\\"accidental\\\" tsunami donation Thursday, January ,  Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan \\u2013 The municipal council of a small town in Canada's Prairies has said it \\\"accidentally\\\" donated $, to the Red Cross for tsunami relief. Now it wants its money back. The council approved the donation during a Jan.  meeting by  votes to . However, the mayor was in the hospital and the deputy mayor, Barry Lewis, who substituted didn't realize he could vote. If he had voted, it would have been against the donation. Some townspeople accused councillor Dorothy Lockwood of ambushing the meeting by presenting the last-minute proposal to divert money from the town's centennial fireworks fund. Lockwood claimed the timing was urgent as the federal government's deadline for matching donations was the next day at midnight. The Red Cross has already deposited the cheque, but has indicated it will return the money.\",\"Iran 'suspends' releasing British soldiers; Shots fired near Iranian Consul in Basra, Iraq Thursday, March ,  Iran's National Security Council has announced that it will \\\"suspend\\\" the releasing of  British sailors and marines detained by Iranian forces on March . \\\"We had decided to release the lady in the group, but with the political ballyhoo by London, this decision will be for the time- being suspended,\\\" said Iranian National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani. On Wednesday, Iran had said that at least one soldier,  year-old Faye Turney, would \\\"be released very soon.\\\" \\\"British leaders have miscalculated this issue. This case may face a legal path\\\" if we are faced with \\\"fuss, and wrong behavior from Britain,\\\" added Larijani. Britain says that they will not negotiate the release of their soldiers saying that there will be \\\"no bargaining.\\\" \\\"The important thing for us is to get them back safe and sound, but we can't enter into some basis of bargaining. What you have to do when you are engaged with people like the Iranian regime, you have to keep explaining to them, very patiently, what it is necessary to do and at the same time make them fully aware there are further measures that will be taken if they're not prepared to be reasonable. What you can't do is end up negotiating over hostages; end up saying there's some quid pro quo or tit for tat; that's not acceptable,\\\" said Tony Blair, the U.K.'s Prime Minister. Iran also stated on Iranian state-run radio that if the United Kingdom goes to the United Nations Security Council or further freezes relations with the nation, they will further delay the release of the soldiers. According to the Reuters news agency, the United Kingdom is circulating a -page draft statement for approval by the U.N. Security Council \\\"deploring\\\" the continuing detention and endorsing UK's stand that the soldiers \\\"were operating in Iraqi waters as part of the Multinational Force-Iraq under a mandate from the Security Council ....and at the request of the government of Iraq. Members of the Security Council support calls for the immediate release of these MNF personnel.\\\" \\\"We are not seeking to put Iran in a corner. We are simply saying, 'Please release the personnel who should not have been seized in the first place,\\\" said a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The sailors and marines from the frigate HMS Cornwall had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution , a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection when Iranian gunboats surrounded the sailors and arrested them at gunpoint. Shots have been reported to be fired at the Iranian Consul in Basra, Iraq. The Iranian Consul said that \\\"British soldiers had surrounded [their] office in the southern city and fired shots into the air\\\" calling the incident a \\\"provocative act\\\" and that the incident \\\"could worsen the situation of the British sailors.\\\" Britain stated that the incident did take place but it was a \\\"geographical coincidence\\\" and that no shots were fired into the air. \\\"A vehicle approached the rear of one of our convoys. A number of rounds were fired. The vehicles returned fire. Nobody dismounted and the vehicle disappeared. There is absolutely no linkage with the location other than geographical coincidence. There was no encirclement and no rounds were fired in the air,\\\" said Major David Gell, a spokesman for the British forces in Basra. No injuries or casualties have been reported.\",\"Nobel prize winner Al Gore urges US and China to do more about global warming Monday, December ,  Global warming campaigner and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore says it is time for humanity to stop \\\"waging war\\\" on planet Earth. Gore spoke today in Oslo after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. He urged the two largest carbon-emitting countries - the United States and China - to make what he called the \\\"boldest moves\\\" to fight global warming. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the  international pact that requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. China was not required to reduce emissions under the deal. They also refused today to approve a new treaty designed to cut emissions by  percent to  percent by . Gore said he would go to the U.N. climate meeting in Bali later this week to urge world leaders to meet as often as every three months to enact a global cap on greenhouse gas emissions by . Gore shared the  Nobel prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, represented at today's ceremony by Rajendra Pachauri. Pachauri stressed the link between the fight against climate change and peace. He warned that severe climate change will trigger what he called \\\"dramatic population migration,\\\" as well as war over water and other resources. He also warned that up to  million people in Africa could face what he called \\\"increased water stress because of climate change.\",\"Gender imbalance in Tsunami deaths Saturday, March ,  Up to four times as many women as men died in the December  Indian Ocean Tsunami, figures published by Oxfam International today reveal. \\\"In some villages it now appears that up to % of those killed were women. This disproportionate impact will lead to problems for years to come unless everyone working on the aid effort addresses the issue now. We are already hearing about rapes, harassment and forced early marriages. We all need to wake up to this issue and ensure the protection, inclusion and empowerment of the women that have survived,\\u201d said, Becky Buell, Oxfam\\u2019s Policy Director. As well as recognition of the disparity, and further research, Oxfam calls for a number of practical measures including assistance for men in affected areas to \\\"adapt to changing gender roles including caring of children\\\" and better protection for women, who may be finding themselves severely outnumbered by men. Beached boat in Galle, Sri Lanca after  Tsunami As well as reporting that workers on the ground have been \\\"becoming increasingly aware that a disproportionate percentage of the fatalities there were female\\\", the study looks in detail at a number of locations in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India, the three countries with greatest death toll from the disaster, and finds consistently that women killed outnumber men. The differences are explained in the report as originating both in differences in ability -- more men can swim and climb trees in the affected areas than women, and men are generally physically stronger -- as well as in differences in activity that the individuals were engaged in at the time the tsunami struck -- many women in Aceh were indoors at home with the children on a Sunday morning, while many men were fishing at sea, or on errands. In India, many of the women were waiting at the sea-shore for men to bring home the catch, when the wave hit. The wave at sea had not yet broken, and so posed no threat to vessels far enough from shore. In Sri Lanka in Batticoloa District, the tsunami hit at the hour women on the east coast usually took their baths in the sea. Women looking after children at the time of the tidal wave were further distracted by trying to save their children, while men away from the house were able to dedicate more of their efforts to saving themselves. Another factor particularly important in Aceh was that many of the men of the region had left to seek work elsewhere, while women stayed behind in their home community, which was almost completely wiped out by the wave. The survey looked at Aceh Besar district of Indonesia, the North Aceh district, the two worst-affected districts of Tamil Naidu in South India, being Nagapattinam and Cuddalore, and used rough statistics and anecdotal information from Sri Lanka, where hard figures are not available.\",\"Volunteers collaborate in reconstruction of Lolol, Chile Saturday, May ,  Today, the day of the National Monuments of Chile, a group of volunteers from Santiago travelled to Lolol, a town located in O'Higgins Region. Lolol, named National Monument of Chile in October , was severely damaged after the major February earthquake; the Church of the town, widely known as one of the oldest in Chile, is currently being restored. \\\"Their attitude is a clear sample of the conscience and love of the Chileans with their legacy, patrimony, especially after the earthquake,\\\" said the Executive Clerk of the National Monuments Council of Chile, \\u00d3scar Acu\\u00f1a, who appreciated their collaboration. Previously,  students of Tourism in the Technical Formation Center of the Los Leones Institute, were working in Lolol, between April  and May , helping to clean up the damage caused by the earthquake. The famous musical group, Bafona, also visited Lolol, and a few other towns that were damaged by the earthquake.\",\"U.S. Government ordered to release more images related to Abu Ghraib case Wednesday, October ,  Alvin K. Hellerstein, a U.S. federal judge, has ordered the release of additional photos and video relating to the on-going Abu Ghraib Iraqi prison abuse case. The media, consisting of  photographs and  videos, were ordered for release on September , pending a  day opportunity for appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act Request in a motion to release the photos. The Bush administration has claimed that the ordered media might provoke terrorists organizations into harming more American soldiers and citizens abroad. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein strongly disagreed, saying that suppressing the pictures amounts to submitting to blackmail. In a statement, Hellerstein said: \\\"Our nation [United States] does not surrender to blackmail, and fear of blackmail is not a legally sufficient argument to prevent us from performing a statutory command.\\\"\",\"Olympic torch faces protests in San Francisco Wednesday, April ,  The Olympic torch relay in San Francisco, California, began today at : p.m. PDT (UTC-). It was the only stop for the torch in the United States, as it makes its way around the world to Beijing, China, for the  Summer Olympics. The route for the torch was materially altered as protesters filled the streets along the planned route. The route, which was originally  kilometres long, was shortened by nearly half, according to the San Francisco Police Department. In hopes that all eighty of the scheduled torch carriers would get a chance to carry the torch, the carriers ran in pairs. The first torch carrier ran as scheduled, but then carried it into a warehouse, from which a motorcycle was observed leaving. The torch was then spotted again on a major street nearly two miles off course. The rerouting was carefully planned, according to San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, who told Associated Press, that it was because of \\\"a disproportionate concentration of people in and around the start of the relay.\\\" The closing ceremonies were held at San Francisco International Airport instead of the planned waterfront location at AT&T Park. Matt Helmenstine, , a California high school teacher carrying a Tibetan flag told Reuters: \\\"I think it's cowardly. If they can't run the torch through the city, it means that no one is supporting the games.\\\" \\\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for us to see the torch,\\\" said Nancy Chan, a local resident, to the San Francisco Chronicle. \\\"There is a lot of politics around it, but that is the great thing about America - the free speech.\\\" She and her -year-old son ran to the new route when it was announced. At least one protester was arrested, Xiao Tan, , of Chinese origin, who tried to unfurl a Tibetan flag. \\\"I'm proud to be Chinese, but I don't like what's happening in Tibet,\\\" he told AFP. The Vancouver Sun reported a number of arrests, but says that violence is limited. Peter Ueberroth, the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee, said that the right balance had been reached, between preserving freedom of speech for protesters, while still providing an exhilarating experience for torchbearers, as well as preventing a repeat of the chaotic demonstrations that accompanied the torch in London and Paris. Already Tuesday evening, hundreds paraded with Tibetan flags while chanting \\\"Shame on China\\\". On Monday, protesters hung banners from the Golden Gate Bridge. As the torch went to London and Paris, the torch relay was subject to large scale protests in both cities. Tight security was planned in advance. Airspace restrictions have been put in place and over  security personnel are expected to be deployed including FBI agents. Police leave was cancelled. The United States Coast Guard patrolled the part of the route that was to take the torch along the waterfront at Fisherman's Wharf. \\\"We are trying to accomplish two goals here. One is to protect the right to free speech and the other is to ensure public safety, and here in San Francisco we are good at both of those things,\\\" said Nathan Ballard about the security. Ballard is a spokesperson for San Francisco Mayor's office. \\\"I am saddened that such a beautiful symbol of the torch, which unites people of different religions, different ethnic origin, different political systems, cultures and languages, has been attacked,\\\" said Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, to the Wall Street Journal. The Beijing Organizing Committee said in a statement on Monday: \\\"We strongly condemn the actions of the few 'pro-Tibet independence' activists who have attempted to sabotage the Olympic Torch Relay. The Olympic flame belongs to the world and these actions are a serious violation of the Olympic spirit. They are bound to fail and will surely arouse the resentment of peace-loving people who support the Olympic Games.\\\"\",\"London bombing: Police search houses in Leeds Tuesday, July ,  West Yorkshire Police searched six houses in Leeds today in connection with the London bombings. Houses were searched in the Burley, Beeston and Holbeck areas. Further properties were searched in Dewsbury, about eight miles from the city centre. The raids began at :30am BST this morning after warrants were issued under the Terrorism Act . Police are still in attendance at one property, and are describing the searches as significant, and \\\"intelligence led\\\". Access to one house was gained using a robot-deployed controlled explosion. Other houses were entered by armed police. London Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair said that the operation \\\"is directly connected to the outrages on Thursday\\\". A \\\"significant amount\\\" of explosives was recovered from the Burley property. Following the discovery of the explosive, military bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene. Around  people were evacuated from the surrounding area. Temporary food and shelter is being provided by the local council at Kirkstall Leisure Centre, a mile away.\",\"Torch of  Summer Olympics won't travel through Taiwan Saturday, September ,  After lots of turns on the route of torch relay of  Summer Olympics, Taiwan and China still insisted their own political positions. The IOC finally announced yesterday that the torch's route will not cross Taiwan. After the route was fixed by IOC, politicians and governments in Taiwan criticized China's behavior. One of Taiwan's  presidential candidates, Ying-jiou Ma (former Taipei City Mayor), commented that without the torch, he can not welcome the torch with National Song and Flag of the Republic of China. Also, Chih-hsiung Huang (KMT Legislator) supposed that Mainland China and Democratic Progressive Party should be criticized on this fault. At the governmental level, Ming-tung Chen (Commissioner of Mainland Affairs Council of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China) mentioned that people in Taiwan do not accept the request on welcoming the torch of  Summer Olympics without Flags, Symbols, and the National Song of the Republic of China, based on the cross-strait common consensus on February , . Chun-hsiung Chang (Premier of the Republic of China) hoped that this fault won't take effect on the tourism between China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Chih-Wei Hsieh (Minister of the Government Information Office of the Republic of China) was proud of the protection of democracy and human rights in Taiwan even though the torch of  Summer Olympics won't come to Taiwan. According to Eastern Television in Taiwan, the reciprocal consensus' between China and Taiwan became cracked slowly, especially in such sporting events as: * Flag of the Republic of China was shown at Davis Cup in Taiwan at April, Cross-Strait Golf Championship and Asian Volleyball Championship at July. This was said to anger the Mainland China National Team. * Mainland China National Team withdrew the  World Deaf Swimming Championship and YONEX  Chinese Taipei Badminton Open. * Ta Meng (Basketball Player of Jiangsu Nangang Team) deliberately elbowed Tai-Hao Wu at Cross-Strait Basketball Championship on September , , and caused some spectators in Taiwan to protest Chinese Taipei Basketball Association and China by drawing Flags of the Republic of China. This Olympic Torch is first-ever declined by an IOC member without warfare factor, even though IOC won't punish Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), but this indicates that the  Summer Olympics may be more faded with politics than previously has occurred. The effects are indicated to be notable after Executive Yuan of Taiwan will promote the \\\"Torch of Joining UN\\\" in October  and the \\\"Human Rights Torch Relay\\\" project by Taiwan newspaper Epoch Times in June .\",\"Four aftershocks hit central Chile; no damages reported Sunday, November ,  Four strong aftershocks have occurred on today's early morning in Chile.

Chile's National System of Tsunami Alerts ruled out the possibility of a tsunami, according to Radio Cooperativa. \\\"In Rancagua, it all was really shake-y,\\\" said Daniela Banda Sandoval, a Facebook user who commented on Pichilemu's Facebook page. \\\"[It was felt] very strong[ly] here in Santa Cruz, in addition of being noisy, it was as strong as the [February] earthquake!,\\\" Agust\\u00edn Toro Reyes said. \\\"At least we are sure now the ONEMI's guy was awake!

Climate Change Conference being held in Bali. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon told reporters it may be too \\\"ambitious\\\" to set targets for greenhouse-gas emissions in the draft text of an agreement aimed at replacing the Kyoto Protocol to stop global warming. Delegates from about  nations, now holding high-level meetings, are split over whether targets should be set now or later. Mr. Ban recognizes the divisions. \\\"Frankly speaking, realistically, it may be too ambitious if delegates would expect to be able to agree on target of greenhouse gas emission reduction,\\\" he said. \\\"But, as I told you, some time down the road we will have to agree on that.\\\" Ministers and heads of states, in a series of speeches, urged nations to lower greenhouse gas emissions. These gases, particularly those caused by the burning of fuels, are believed by many scientists to contribute to global warming. Leaders said rich nations should make the first cuts and help poorer nations to develop clean technology. The United States strongly opposes emission targets, as do Japan and Canada. U.S. officials say including emission targets would prejudge negotiations expected over the next two years to find a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in . But the European Union and environmentalists say setting emission targets in the draft will show that industrialized nations are serious about the fight against global warming. The U.S. under-secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, Paula Dobriansky, who is heading the U.S. delegation to Bali, says Washington is committed to seeing an agreement reached at the Bali conference. \\\"We are very committed to working toward a successful outcome here in Bali. We want to launch a process that is open and does not predetermine or preclude options,\\\" she said. \\\"We have been listening carefully to the perspectives of others and will continue to do so in the days ahead. We hope to identify a way forward that will bridge our differences and bring us together on common pursuit of our shared goal of addressing climate change.\\\" The text of the conference draft is expected to undergo several revisions before being finalized Friday. It calls for industrialized nations to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by between  to  percent by the year . The Bali conference is expected to end on Friday.\",\"US government to resume Haiti evacuations Tuesday, February ,  The United States government will resume evacuation flights for injured Haitians following doctors advising that many were likely to die if they did not receive immediate medical care. Airlifts stopped Wednesday due to logistical issues. Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said on Sunday that airlifts should resume within the next twelve hours. Vietor said Haitians with spinal injuries and burns were flown to the U.S., most for treatment in Florida. The state's governor, Charlie Crist, advised the Obama administration last week that Florida's healthcare system was be called on to deal with a considerable number of injured from Haiti; that victims had high-trauma injuries, only increasing the strain on the healthcare system available in Florida. Crist requested the Federal Government activate the National Disaster Medical System, which often provides the necessary funds for disaster victims. The World Food Programme (WFP) also began delivering food to Haitian women on Sunday. A spokesperson stated that they had decided to only release food to the women in an effort to reduce violence caused by the starvation dilemma. Rice was distributed in sixteen locations across Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. The WFP gave 25kg (or  pounds) of rice to each woman, enough rice to feed an average family in Haiti for two weeks.\",\"UK naval crew describe their capture and detention by Iran Friday, April ,  At a press conference held Friday at the Royal Marine Base Chivenor in Devon, first-hand details of the fifteen UK Royal Navy crew's capture and detention by Iran were revealed. The fifteen navy crew, eight from the Royal Navy (RN) and seven from the Royal Marines (RM), arrived by helicopter at the base on Thursday. Following a period of debriefing and rest, the crew spoke at a press conference on Friday. Captain Christopher Air, RM, and Lieutenant Felix Carman, RN, spoke for the group. Carman and Air thanked the staff of the British Embassy in Tehran, the Foreign Office, and Ministry of Defence for securing their release. In addition, Air stated that the crew \\\"would like to thank the very many members of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who have been working so hard over the last  weeks supporting our families and friends and for arranging our return to here.\\\" Carman provided details of the navigational equipment and hand held GPS used by the UK crew. A support helicopter also provided continuous navigational confirmation. The boarding crew were linked electronically to HMS Cornwall, which monitored the crew's position continually. \\\"Let me make it absolutely clear,\\\" said Carman. \\\"Irrespective of what has been said in the past, when we were detained by the IRG we were inside internationally recognised Iraqi territorial waters and I can clearly state we were . nautical miles from Iranian waters.\\\" Having boarded an unidentified merchant vessel in the Shatt Al Arab waterway, the crew were stopped by two Iranian boats, which prevented them from leaving. \\\"When we tried to leave, they prevented us by blocking us in,\\\" explained Air. \\\"By now it was becoming increasingly clear that they had arrived with a planned intent. Some of the Iranian sailors were becoming deliberately aggressive and unstable. They rammed our boat and trained their heavy machine guns, RPGs and weapons on us.\\\" Six other Iranian boats arrived. \\\"We made a conscious decision to not engage the Iranians and do as they asked,\\\" said Air. \\\"They boarded our boats, removed our weapons and steered the boats towards the Iranian shore.\\\" On arrival at an Iranian naval base, the UK crew were stripped of their gear, blindfolded, and led to an interrogation room. The following morning the group was flown to Tehran and transported to a prison where they faced \\\"constant psychological pressure.\\\" The crew were stripped and dressed in pajamas. According to Carman, \\\"the next few nights were spent in stone cells, approximately 'x ', sleeping on piles of blankets. All of us were kept in isolation.\\\" They were interrogated most nights and offered two options. \\\"If we admitted we had strayed, we would be on a plane back to the UK soon,\\\" said Carman. \\\"If we didn't we faced up to seven years in prison.\\\" The crew were kept in isolation until the last few nights, when they were allowed to gather together for a couple of hours at a time. On the subject of deciding to resist the Iranians or not, Air was adamant that it would have made the situation worse. \\\"Let me be absolutely clear, from the outset it was very apparent that fighting back was simply not an option,\\\" said Air. \\\"Had we chosen to do so then many of us would not be standing here today.\\\"\",\"US nationals arrested for alleged abduction of Haitian children Monday, February ,  Haitian police yesterday arrested ten United States nationals, five men and five women, over the alleged abduction of  children. The nationals tried to cross with the children, aged between two months and twelve years, into the Dominican Republic, but were halted at the border. Lots of children have been affected by the earthquake. The group belongs to the two-month-old New Life Children's Refuge charity, with some members from Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Eastside Baptist Church in Twin Falls, Idaho, and others from Texas and Kansas. Their claimed intention was to move the quake victims to a temporary orphanage being set up in a hotel-resort in the neighbouring Dominican Republic. Police said the Americans did not have any paperwork or permissions to remove the children from the country. Haiti's government has imposed new restrictions on adoptions due to concerns about child trafficking during the post-disaster confusion. The detainees are being held near the capital, Port-au-Prince, and maintain their arrest was a mistake. Laura Silsby, the group's spokeswoman, insisted on the group acting in good faith and they paid no money for the children. She defended the lack of any authority from Haitian officials, \\\"I was going to come back here to do the paperwork,\\\" asserting that Haitian pastor Jean Sanbil, of the Sharing Jesus Ministries, allowed them to move the children. She claimed, \\\"[w]e had permission from the Dominican Republic government to bring the children to an orphanage that we have there.\\\" Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive disagreed strongly with group's actions; \\\"[w]e did not arrest Americans, we arrested kidnappers.\\\" Social Affairs minister, Yves Christallin, told Agence France-Presse that it was \\\"abduction, not an adoption\\\". He continued, \\\"what is important for us in Haiti is that a child needs to have authorisation from this ministry to leave the country\\\". He stressed, \\\"[t]his is totally illegal, [...] these people did not have that authorization.\\\" Kent Page, a spokesman for UNICEF in Haiti, also weighed in today saying, \\\"[y]ou can't just go and take a child out of a country \\u2013 no matter what country you are in.\\\" The NCLR group planned to take around  children to the Dominican Republic. According to their mission statement, the Baptists' intent was to \\\"find healing, hope, joy and new life in Christ\\\" for the Roman Catholic children \\\"as well as opportunities for adoption into a loving Christian family.\\\" To that end they partnered with New Life Adoption Foundation to \\\"help facilitate adoptions and provide grants to subsidize the cost of adoption for loving Christian parents who would otherwise not be able to afford to adopt.\\\" They envisioned building an orphanage at Villa Magante on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, with facilities for the children, and lodging and amenities for \\\"adopting parents to stay while fulfilling requirement for \\u2010 day visit as well as Christian volunteers\\u002fvacationing families.\\\" The children have been transferred to an SOS Children's village in Santo, to the north of the capital. The site has a medical facility run by the Dominican Red Cross. Staff reported the children were \\\"in a very bad emotional state\\\" and that a small baby had to be temporarily taken to the main hospital. Some children told staff they actually have parents, and a twelve year old said she and her family had believed the New Life Children's Refuge group wanted to take her to a boarding school in the Dominican Republic. Later, three people arrived at the SOS Children's village claiming to be relatives of five of the children. They said, \\\"the woman who took the children to DR\\\" told them she organised summer camps in the neighbouring country; they declared they did not intent to permanently part with their children. Amarick Louis, Haiti's justice secretary, told the Associated Press that a commission would decide today if the group would go before a judge. Senior Pastor Clint Henry of the Central Valley Baptist Church told reporters New Life Children's Refuge, and the Haiti mission, are separate from the -year-old church. He noted that members of the church were confronted with negative feedback after the arrest of the NLCR group. His congregation prayed for the arrested members of their church during services on Sunday.\",\"New earthquake hits Chile Friday, May ,  A strong earthquake hit Chile at approximately at : local time ( UTC) on Friday.

Wikinews reporter Diego Grez, who was in Santa Cruz at the time of the tremor, reported that the power went out for approximately  minutes and people evacuated their houses quickly. In Pichilemu, the power also went out, but came back in a few minutes. Desperate people quickly ran to the now well-known La Cruz Hill.

The news comes on the same day that it was announced that forest clearance in the Amazon Rainforest was falling compared to previous years. Delegates from about  countries are negotiating a plan for private companies and wealthy nations to pay poorer nations to keep their forest intact. It is called the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries, or REDD proposal. Environmental scientists say tree cutting in tropical areas accounts for about  percent of all man-made carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming. Tropical forests soak up vast amounts of carbon dioxide; burning timber to clear land releases it. Marcelo Furtado with Greenpeace in Brazil says the REDD plan is needed to fill gaps in the current Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to limit emissions of greenhouse gases which does not include ways to preserve forests. \\\"We would like to see, at the very least, a REDD mechanism moving forward, because we want to see countries taking action now. We don't want to wait to  to start seeing this action taking place. And this is something this convention, this group of countries could deliver,\\\" said Furtado. Frances Seymour, Director General for the Indonesia-based Center for International Forest Research, is concerned a premature REDD agreement could do more harm than good. \\\"Because in many forested countries, land tenure rights to forest lands and resources are either unclear or contested or both. And you can imagine that if a potential new income stream is available for those who can present themselves as owners of the forest, this could create conflict and create conditions under which some of the world's poorest people, who are people who live in forests, could be pushed aside,\\\" said Seymour. Financial analysts are also cautious about the proposal. Charlotte Streck, the director of Climate Focus, a Rotterdam-based consultancy, said investors are worried about how governments would monitor their forests and ensure the carbon stored in them remains intact. \\\"This is what makes the private sector nervous, because these are risks that they cannot hedge properly, and that they cannot evaluate in the same manner as the project related risks,\\\" she said. Conference delegates are still debating how to monitor the world's remaining tropical forests, how to stop logging in one place without shifting the problem to another area, and how to estimate the amount of carbon in a piece of land. Yvo de Boer, the U.N.'s climate change chief, said a REDD agreement is unlikely during this conference, but a group working on the details is making significant progress.\",\"British navy personnel back home Thursday, April ,  The fifteen British navy personnel detained by Iran landed at just gone : noon BST at Heathrow International Airport, following their release after thirteen days of captivity. The sailors and marines were captured by Iranian border guards on March  in the Persian Gulf near the Shatt al Arab waterway. Iran says they were in Iranian territorial waters while the UK insists they were operating in Iraqi waters under the terms of a UN mandate. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday announced that he would free the fifteen British captured navy personnel as a \\\"gift to the British people.\\\" The crew are back on British soil, after landing in an area usually reserved for VIPs such as the Queen, and have arrived at a military base for de-briefing and thorough mental and physical health checks, and to meet their waiting families. They left Iran at approximately : a.m local time from Mehrabad International Airport located in Tehran, Iran and were flown to Royal Marines Base Chivenor by Westland Sea King helicopters just minutes after leaving the British Airways BA6634 flight that had taken them back to the United Kingdom. At exactly  noon BST, British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a statement outside  Downing Street, saying that he was \\\"glad\\\" that the crew had returned safely, and firmly stating that \\\"no deal\\\" had been made with the Iranians to secure the release. He also repeated his government's view that there were \\\"elements of the Iranian regime\\\" that were \\\"financing, arming and supporting terrorism in Iraq\\\". Iranian state television had ran live video showing Mr Ahmadinejad smiling, chatting and shaking the hands of some of the detainees. \\\"We are grateful for your forgiveness,\\\" one servicemen said to Mr. Ahmadinejad. After Ahmadinejad's announcement on Wednesday that he was releasing the troops, British Prime Minister Tony Blair had told reporters that \\\"We bear you [Iran] no ill will. On the contrary, we respect Iran as an ancient civilization, as a nation with a proud and dignified history. The disagreements we have with your government we wish to resolve peacefully through dialogue. I hope - as I've always hoped - that in the future we are able to do so.\\\" Ray Cooper, uncle to Royal Marine Adam Sperry one of the fifteen captured, said that this is \\\"the best present imaginable. Whoever has been in the right or wrong, the whole thing has been a political mess, so let's just get them home\\\", whilst his grandmother, Margaret Sperry, said that \\\"I don't think I would have ever gone out of the door again if anything had happened to him.\\\"\",\"Human Rights Watch: US abuse of Iraqi prisoners continues Sunday, July ,  A report is published by Human Rights Watch on treatment of prisoners in Iraq by US soldiers after the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. It claims torture and other abuses against detainees in US custody in Iraq continues and is authorised and routine. The report includes detailed accounts of abuse from detention centers throughout Iraq, and allegations from an Army interrogator stationed at Camp Nama at Baghdad International Airport. The -page report titled No Blood, No Foul: Soldiers' Accounts of Detainee Abuse in Iraq claims that that harsh interrogation techniques were approved by commanders. Soldiers describe how detainees were routinely subjected to severe beatings, painful stress positions, severe sleep deprivation, and exposure to extreme cold and hot temperatures. The accounts come from interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch, supplemented by memoranda and sworn statements contained in declassified documents. Marc Garlasco, Human Rights Watch military analyst, said \\\"Up to now, a lot of allegations and evidence has been floating around about authorization up the chain of command of abusive techniques,\\\" \\\"MPs on trial tried to raise this in their defense and got nowhere. For the first time, we have been provided clear information on the scope of authorization of abusive techniques, and it points directly to officers in charge and the Pentagon.\\\" John Sifton, researcher at Human Rights Watch said \\\"Soldiers were told that the Geneva Conventions did not apply, and that interrogators could use abusive techniques to get detainees to talk.\\\" The Department of Defense denies any Pentagon approval for any abuse. Lt. Col. Mark Ballesteros, a Pentagon spokesman says \\\"DoD policy has and always will be the humane treatment of detainees in its custody.\\\" He said there is a task force in Iraq that oversees detainee operations and has made a dozen reviews of detainee policies. None of the reviews found that the Department of Defense ever ordered or condoned detainee abuse. The Human Rights Watch report recommends appointing a bipartisan commission to investigate the range of detainee abuse in Iraq, overhauling the military justice system, and appointing an independent prosecutor to investigate and prosecute those responsible. Marc Garlasco said \\\"In the current situation of long occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan with troop rotation, there is no reason an independent prosecutor can't deal with abuse allegations,\\\" \\\"It would make a difference if the E- (private first class) in the field saw some senior officers or flags that had authorized abuse being tried in courts-martial instead of promoted.\\\"\",\"Tour de France: Alexandre Vinokourov wins stage  Monday, July ,  Alexandre Vinokourov of Kazakhstan has won stage  of the  Tour de France in a time of 5h ' \\\".

The winner, Australian Robbie McEwan, claimed the Green jersey while Fabian Cancellara held onto the leaders yellow jersey. Fellow Briton Mark Cavendish suffered bike troubles throughout the whole stage. Millar did not go without, he was awarded the polka dot jersey for king of the mountains. Atmosphere at Jubilee Gardens The show got underway as the caravane set off from the Mall at half eight. Dance beats, giant cows, and French tinged words of encouragement, momentarily woke the early birds from their patient wait for the main event. As they waited curious by-passers swapped photography tips, and thoughts on cycling as the youngest members wondered what the fuss was all about. Council workmen commented on how easy it was to get work done, with no car traffic on the roads. Again the policing was low key and friendly with the Gendarme Nationale cutting a dash amongst their British colleagues. British bobbies rode in French vehicles, and French argents in British ones. Riding well in advance of the Tour, French and British motorcycle policemen swapped tips and compared notes as they passed. The Frenchmen bringing more than a little Gallic charm and swagger to the proceedings. The crowd behind Jubilee Gardens grew as the start time of twenty-five past ten approached, an event presaged by an ever increasing number of press and support vehicles. As Big Ben chimed the hour in the background a quartet of helicopters in the sky above the River Thames began to jostle for position; a dance mirrored on the ground as anticipation grew. Slowly the dribble that was the vanguard of press and support vehicles became a torrent. A wave of cheers rung out, announcing finally the arrival of the riders. Despite their being almost  riders the speeding cyclists had come and gone in a matter of minutes, however the show was not yet over. For a quarter of an hour afterwards tour buses, and still yet more support vehicles followed in the wake of the cyclists. As the police began to remove their restrictions on the crowds and traffic, a final rear guard of race fans emulating their heroes brought up the rear. Despite some not being in the best of condition and some riding rather rickety bikes, these fans still managed to get an enthusiastic cheer of encouragement from the remaining onlookers. With the Tour continuing on its way and it still not yet , some amongst the myriad of spectators began to make their way to the large outside video screens to continue watching the race, others preferring to sample the shops, sights, smells and tastes of the waking City. With some others choosing to sit in the sun, and lie in the park, no doubt making up for an early start.\",\"UK freezes business arrangements with Iran; detained sailors and marines shown on TV Wednesday, March ,  The United Kingdom has frozen all bilateral business deals with Iran until all  British sailors and marines, who were detained by Iranian forces on March  are released. \\\"We will therefore be imposing a freeze on all other official bilateral business with Iran until this situation is resolved. We will keep other aspects of our policy with Iran under close review and continue to proceed carefully,\\\" said British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett to the House of Commons. Margaret Beckett Further evidence was also presented that the U.K. says proves that the  sailors and marines were in fact inside Iraqi waters when they were detained. \\\"The position was  degrees, . minutes north; , . minutes east, and this places her . nautical miles inside Iraqi territorial waters,\\\" said Vice Admiral Charles Style who also said that Iran provided the British government with two different sets of coordinates, the first of which showed the British boats in Iraqi waters, but then the second set of coordinates, which had shown corrections, had shown the boats to be in Iranian waters. Mohammad Reza Bahonar, the deputy speaker of the Majlis of Iran has stated that if it is determined that the British sailors were in Iranian water, then the country would expect the British to apologize for the incident. \\\"If it is proven that a mistake has been made the issue will be resolved with an apology from the British government. If it is proven to be intentional, the British government should explain its aim and clarify how it is going to compensate,\\\" he said. Footage of all  British sailors and marines have been broadcast on Iranian TV, with one of the sailors, Faye Turney, , saying that the soldiers were in Iranian waters at the time of their detainment, a move in which Britain calls \\\"completely unacceptable.\\\" Turney was wearing a black \\\"head scarf\\\" which is a traditional wearing for Islamic countries. According to the Iranian Foreign Minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, the female sailor will \\\"be released very soon,\\\" but did not state when the other  sailors and marines would be released.

European states are pushing for steep reductions in emissions, but environmentalists accuse some others of dragging their feet. The European Union's climate chief, Artur Runge Metzger, says his organization wants greenhouse emissions cut by half by the middle of the century. \\\"We would like to see global average temperatures rise no more than an average of two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels,\\\" Metzger said. \\\"And that would require that global emissions go down by at least  percent of the  emissions by the year .\\\" Greenhouse emissions are thought to be causing global warming. Metzger downplayed differences between the EU and other countries on reduction targets, saying he believes the response to the  percent proposal has been increasingly positive. He noted that Japan, Canada and some members of the U.S. congress have expressed support for the idea. Those same countries, however, have been targeted by environmental groups, who say they have failed in their initial statements here to come out strongly enough for significant cuts. Hans Verolme of the group WWF says Japan is being criticized for not including binding targets in its proposal for emission control discussions. \\\"That in our view would be quite disastrous. It would delay action and it would in fact lead to dangerous climate change,\\\" Verolme said. Japan says its proposal is merely an attempt to get the conversation started, and U.N. climate change chief Yvo de Boer has also sought to downplay any differences. De Boer repeatedly points out that the Bali conference is not meant to produce a new climate-change treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol. That  agreement is set to expire in . \\\"This meeting in Bali will not finalize a post- climate change deal, that's much too complicated to do in  days, but what it can do is put in place a two-year process to work towards such a deal,\\\" De Boer said. Even the two-degree temperature rise that the European Union talks about is predicted to have serious effects on humans and the environment. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted such a rise would increase the frequency of damaging storms, and make  percent of the world's species more vulnerable to extinction. Thousands of delegates from more than  countries are meeting in Bali, which is due to run through December .\",\"Haiti rescue effort abandoned Saturday, January ,  The United Nations has announced that the government of Haiti has put an end to its efforts to find and rescue buried survivors of the earthquake that hit the region eleven days ago. The announcement comes just a day after two people were found alive. According to Elizabeth Byrs, the UN spokeswoman,  people have been rescued since the earthquake hit. The death toll, as of Friday, is estimated to be ,. It is thought that the chances of survival are so slim that it is not worth the resources required for a successful rescue operation. Byrs called the decision to end the rescue effort \\\"heartbreaking\\\", but added that it had been advised by experts. Only yesterday, an -year-old woman was found\\u2014severely injured and dehydrated\\u2014in the rubble of her home, and Emmannuel Buso, aged , was rescued by an Israeli search team. He said that he was coming out of the shower when the earthquake hit, and survived ten days by drinking his own urine. There is currently no information on whether the Israeli team will also stop their rescue efforts. Shortly after the announcement, a French rescue team reported that it was trying to save a man who is trapped under the ruins of a hotel and supermarket. They cannot yet see the man, who said that he saw the team's light, and that as many as five other people are trapped with him. The rescue team said that it could take two hours to rescue the man. It is hoped that removing focus from the rescue operation will allow more money and effort to be diverted to the logistically difficult relief effort, which has already seen planes arriving at the now operational Port-au-Prince airport at a rate of  per day and a United States Navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, moored outside the partly-operational seaport. At least , people have been relocated out of Port-au-Prince, say the UN, whose World Food Program has provided approximately  million meals to starving people and calls the current operation \\\"the most complex operation WFP has ever launched\\\".

The Conference is the place where formal decisions regarding the Kyoto Protocol will be made and discussed. Several participants and observers agree that getting on track for a regulatory agreement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for  onwards is going be one of the main challenges in the upcoming talks. Setting an agenda and a date for completion of negotiations on a post- climate change agreement at the upcoming conference in Bali is of great importance, stated Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in an interview given to Inter Press Service last week. De Boer declared that he does not \\\"expect Bali to agree on targets and finalise a regime\\\", and sees the real work in \\\"designing a global agreement that encompasses every country while recognising the need of different approaches with different people\\\" during the short span of the next two years. However, making the decision to launch negotiations is a prerequisite to this, and in that regards he says that \\\"...for me Bali is very much a make or a break.\\\" The European Commission said in a press release from Tuesday: \\\"The [...] conference [...] must agree to launch negotiations on a comprehensive and ambitious global climate change agreement for the period after , when the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period ends.\\\" The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown stated in a speech that \\\"the task of Bali sounds quite specific: to launch negotiations leading to a post- global agreement on climate change. But our mission is in truth historic and it is world changing\\u2014to build over the next  years and beyond a global low carbon economy.\\\" The United States seems to agree as the Department of State noted in a press release that \\\"we are committed to developing an environmentally effective and economically sustainable post- framework to address climate change.\\\" In its information for the press, the UNFCCC secretariat states that the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report made it unmistakenably clear that the problem and danger of global warming needs to be tackled immediately, and with a world wide response.

France's military, meanwhile, was several hundred miles away, searching the waters near Cape Verde. Airplanes from Senegal and Spain have also been sent out to help out in the search effort. French officials have also asked for United States satellite data to help with the search. \\\"We want to try to reach the last point where the aircraft made contact, which is about ,200km [ miles] north-east of Natal [located in Brazil],\\\" said Colonel Jorge Amaral, a spokesman for the Brazil air force. French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he was pessimistic that any survivors would be found. \\\"This is a catastrophe the likes of which Air France has never seen before. I said the truth to them: the prospects of finding survivors are very low,\\\" the president said to reporters at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France. The Pentagon has also ordered aircraft to assist in finding the plane. The Airbus A330 had departed from Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night, with a dozen crew members and  passengers on board, according to a spokeswoman for Air France. The jet was in a normal cruise at  kilometres per hour at about , metres above sea level when it disappeared, almost four hours after having departed. No problems were apparent when the aircraft made its last radar contact. Air France said that the aeroplane \\\"crossed through a thunderous zone with strong turbulence\\\" at about . local time (. GMT). Approximately fourteen minutes later, an automated message was sent saying that the cabin had lost its pressurisation and that the electrical system of the aircraft had failed. If no survivors are found, then this would be the worst aviation disaster since the November  American Airlines Flight  crash.\",\"Magnitude . earthquake hits Chile as president is sworn in Saturday, March ,  A magnitude . earthquake struck Chile on Thursday, just  minutes before the country's new president, Sebasti\\u00e1n Pi\\u00f1era, was due to be sworn in.

Allegedly involved in the second set of attacks on London in July, which targeted the city's public transport infrastructure, Osman was arrested in Rome by Italian police on July , just one week after the failed attacks. On September , a final appeal against extradition was rejected by an Italian court despite his lawyer's protests that he could not get a fair trial in the UK. Osman is accused of planting the failed bomb at Shepherd's Bush Underground station. His flight subsequent to the attack proved futile as phone records led police to Rome, and a raid on his brother's apartment, where he was captured. Pending his extradition, he was held at Rebibbia jail, Rome, a high-security facility on the outskirts of the city. He left the jail late on Thursday and the Ethiopian-born terror suspect flew out of Italy at 12pm local time, accompanied by officers from the Metropolitan police. Flying on a chartered private jet, Osman and his escort landed at RAF Northolt, where Osman was charged on arrival. He is expected to be put on trial at the Old Bailey in London, alongside the other suspects involved in the failed attacks.\",\"Beijing  Olympics comes to a close Sunday, August ,  The  Summer Olympics were formally declared closed during a colourful ceremony at the iconic Beijing National Stadium with the Olympics flag being handed over to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson.

The riders had . km in front of them when they started around  a.m. this morning in Waregem, Belgium, heading for the French town Compi\\u00e8gne, which is known also as the start of the race Paris-Roubaix. Remarkably, the riders didn't go faster than  km\\u002fhour most of the stage, so they came in an hour behind schedule after almost seven hours in the saddle.

A military official told the New York Times that flights to the US were stopped on Wednesday, as some hospitals didn't want to receive the refugees. \\\"Apparently, some states were unwilling to accept the entry of Haitian patients for follow-on critical care. We manage air evacuation missions, but without a destination to fly to we can't move anybody. If we don't have permission to bring them, or they won't take them in, we can't fly the mission. It's pretty simple,\\\" US Transportation Command spokesman Capt Kevin Aandahl said yesterday. He did not say, however, which states specifically refused more evacuees. The New York Times reports that five hundred victims of the quake have been treated in Florida so far. A spokesman for Floridian governor Charlie Crist, however, commented that he wasn't aware of any hospitals in the state refusing to accept more evacuees. In a letter to US Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius earlier this week, however, the governor commented that \\\"Florida's healthcare system is quickly reaching saturation, especially in the area of high-level trauma care,\\\" and asked for the National Disaster Medical System to be activated. That system is primarily used to help fund victims of domestic disasters. A doctor in the earthquake-ravaged country, however, remarked that many of his patients could die if not airlifted soon. \\\"We have  critically ill patients who will die in the next day or two if we don't med-evac them,\\\" said Doctor Green, chairman for the University of Miami's Global Institute for Community Health and Development, to the Associated Press.

Contradicting claims made by some media outlets, SBS Dateline's executive producer Mike Carey claimed on Thursday that the program's researchers have found cases of Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse that have not been dealt with by US authorities. He described the new images available to SBS as a \\\"quantum leap\\\" compared to the previously broadcast pictures. Carey announced that next week's program will show more abuse pictures, but he noted that some images featuring prisoners in sexually humiliating acts will not be broadcast, as they were deemed too graphic. Next week's program will also include interviews with a US soldier that has been convicted of prisoner abuse and another former soldier who witnessed the crimes. The Washington Post has noted, as suggested by SBS, that several news outlets including themselves have \\\"not published a substantial number of photographs they are holding.\\\" The Washington Post further explains that \\\"Newspapers that have held these images have been constrained, in large part, by the sheer graphic nature of them, especially the nudity.\\\" The Washington Post also cites SBS's ability to circumvent \\\"the U.S. government's efforts to keep Abu Ghraib images out of the public eye\\\" as another reason why the images were not first published by other media outlets. The U.S. internet news site Salon has now published some of their own previously held back pictures and confirmed that they possess \\\"files and other electronic documents from an internal Army investigation into the Abu Ghraib prisoner-abuse scandal\\\", which include the originally published pictures, as well as the ones published by SBS. Salon notes that some of the files from the Criminal Investigation Command refer to CIA agents that interrogated prisoners at Abu Ghraib, but that no CIA officers have been prosecuted \\\"despite the death of at least one Iraqi during a CIA interrogation there\\\", underscoring the claim made by SBS that some of the pictures document previously unprosecuted abuse. The US government expressed concerns about the new abuse pictures being published. John Bellinger of the State Department told BBC, \\\"We felt that it was an invasion of the privacy of the detainees themselves to have these photographs come out... (and that the publication could also) fan the flames around the world and cause potentially further violence\\\".\",\"USA leaving Abu Ghraib Friday, March ,  United States army officers stated that the Abu Ghraib prison will be closed within months, and its prisoners moved to other prisons and camps in Iraq. Some of the  detainees will be sent to the new Camp Cropper, which is built for this special purpose. The operation of Abu Ghraib will be transferred to the government of Iraq. Lieutenant Colonel Keir-Kevin Curry said: \\\"No precise dates have been set, but the plan is to accomplish this within the next two to three months.\\\" Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, military spokesman, says \\\"Clearly there's a lot of emotion attached to Abu Ghraib. For Iraqis, it dates back a lot further than abuses committed by American soldiers, and it makes it a magnet for attacks.\\\" The prison complex was a widely feared center for torture and execution under Saddam Hussein, and as many as , people were executed in the prison in . The buildings at Abu Ghraib were originally built by British contractors in the 1960s. Pictures of extensive detainee abuse in Abu Ghraib taken inside the prison in November  had been released earlier this year. In January , a United States Army court martial proceeding found Army Spc. Charles Graner guilty of abusing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison. The jury sentenced Graner to ten years in prison. A total of nine other American soldiers were found guilty in allegations stemming from the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal.\",\"British sailors detained by Iran \\\"to be tried for espionage\\\" Sunday, March ,  The Australian has reported that an internet website \\\"run by associates of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\\" states that the  British sailors who were arrested by Iranian Revolutionary Guards could face charges of espionage. The source website for this claim remains unknown; however, Rajanews.com, a news website run by some of supporters of Ahmadinejad said on their website: \\\"If the charges of espionage is brought against them the result would be heavy punishment by current law.\\\" \\\"If it is proven that they deliberately entered Iranian territory, they will be charged with espionage. If that is proven, they can expect a very serious penalty since according to Iranian law, espionage is one of the most serious offenses,\\\" said the news report which also called the sailors \\\"insurgents.\\\" Individuals who are tried and found guilty of espionage or spying would be penalized by death, according to Iranian law. An inflatable British patrol boat similar to the two seized by Iran on March , . (File photo: Patrol boat assigned to HMS Cardiff seen in Iraq in ) The Iranian government initially gave the position of the incident as being outside Iranian territorial waters. General Alireza Afshar, Iran's top military general, then stated that the sailors were engaged \\\"in illegal and suspicious activities\\\" inside Iranian waterways at the time of their detention and that the sailors \\\"have admitted to violating the territorial waters of the Islamic republic\\\". After the UK queried the statement by General Alireza Afshar, the Iranian government gave a revised position for the incident, now placing it inside Iranian territorial waters. Reports also say that the sailors are being held until five Iranian guards, detained in Iraq by the United States early in , are released to the Iranian government. \\\"As soon as the corps\\u2019s five members are released, the Britons can go home,\\\" an unnamed source close to the command of Qods Force, who also said that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei approved of the trade off. The sailors and marines, from the frigate HMS Cornwall, had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution , a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection when Iranian gunboats surrounded the sailors and arrested them at gunpoint. Reports also say that the sailors were taken to the Iranian capital of Tehran where they are allegedly going to appear before a court. It is not known when they will appear before the court in Iran or when the hearing will be held. As a result of the detention of the sailors, the United Kingdom has activated their \\\"COBRA emergency committee\\\", which is Britain's crisis management team as the U.K. denies that the sailors were in Iranian waters. Tony Blair, the U.K.'s Prime Minister, calls the situation \\\"unjustified and wrong.\\\" \\\"This is a very serious situation and there is no doubt at all that these people were taken from a boat in Iraqi waters. I hope the Iranian government understands how fundamental an issue this is for us. They should not be under any doubt at all about how seriously we regard this act, which was unjustified and wrong. It is simply not true that they went into Iranian territorial waters,\\\" Blair claimed during a news conference today who also stated that the situation could be resolved within the next couple of days. \\\"The quicker it is resolved, the easier it will be for all of us,\\\" added Blair. In a press release March , Foreign Office Minister Lord Triesman stated, \\\"We've been insisting that [the sailors] should be released immediately - there is no reason to hold them - that they should be released unharmed and that we should be in a position to assure their families that they are in good health and that they're safe.\\\" Triesman indicated that meetings have taken place with Iranian officials over the release of the seized British sailors, and that \\\"they're delicate discussions.\\\"\",\"UK prepared to go 'into different phase' if sailors and marines not released by Iran within days Tuesday, March ,  On Tuesday Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair said in a televised interview that if the  sailors and marines who were arrested by Iranian forces are not released then Britain will be forced to \\\"move into a different phase\\\" of operations, and that Iran has only days to release all  sailors and marines. \\\"I hope we manage to get them [the Iranian government] to realize they have to release them. If not, then this will move into a different phase. I hope that this is resolved in the next few days,\\\" said Blair also adding that it would be \\\"easier for all of us.\\\" He was asked if he could elaborate on what he meant and responded by saying that \\\"we will just have to see, but what they should understand is that we cannot have a situation where our servicemen and women are seized when actually they are in Iraqi waters under a UN mandate, patrolling perfectly rightly and in accordance with that mandate, and then effectively captured and taken to Iran.\\\" The sailors and marines from the frigate HMS Cornwall had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution , a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq (though it was subsequently cleared after inspection), when Iranian gunboats surrounded the sailors and arrested them at gunpoint. Blair also added that the British government is still trying to resolve the issue by \\\"diplomatic means.\\\" \\\"What we are trying to do at the moment is to pursue this through the diplomatic channels and make the Iranian government understand these people have to be released and that there is absolutely no justification whatever for holding them,\\\" added Blair. Iran stated Tuesday that the sailors and marines are being treated \\\"humanely\\\" and are in \\\"good health.\\\" \\\"They are in completely good health. Rest assured that they have been treated with humanitarian and moral behavior,\\\" said Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Ali Hosseini who also added that the one female sailor had \\\"complete privacy.\\\" On Sunday, The Australian reported that an internet website \\\"run by associates of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\\" states that the  British sailors who were arrested by Iranian Revolutionary Guards could face charges of espionage.

The lack of communication made it difficult to rescue people, who were underneath rubble. Hospitals had collapsed, raising fears that the injured wouldn't be able to receive treatment. There's an urgent need for rescue volunteers, hospitals, emergency health, water purification and telecommunications. At least  aftershocks followed. The mass media warn of tsunami, although the Atmospheric Administration rejected it. Eight days later left much of the nation in ruins. Officials estimated the initial earthquake killed about , people and affected three million. According to the President of Haiti was a total disaster. Nine days after the earthquake the government of Haiti put an end to efforts to find any rescue buried survivors. The announcement came just a day after two people were found alive. It was hoped that removing focus from the rescue operation would allow more money and effort to be diverted to the logistically relief effort. Haiti was facing increasing insecurity from human traffickers and convicts escaped from collapsed prisons. Child trafficking was an other serious issue. The Red Cross and Unicef had started to register orphaned children, and sent some to orphanages for shelter. It's expected that reconstruction could take decades. The remaining forces were rallying as the U.S. military stopped the transport of victims from Haiti because of concerns about the cost of hospitalization. After doctors' calls, the U.S. government resumed its flights for transporting injured despite some objections. The WFP was trying to reduce violence caused by starvation.\",\"Tributes paid to the victims of the July   London bombings Four years after the \\u002f London bombings, when  people were killed and about  were injured by a series of suicide bombings on transport networks, a . tonne stainless steel plaque with the names of the victims has been unveiled in Hyde Park.  stainless steel columns standing .5m tall were also inaugurated. All four suicide bombers were UK residents. Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but police are unsure of its exact role in the attack. Survivors of the bombings launched a campaign for public inquiry, which was rejected by the British government as too expensive and time-consuming. The government's attitude infuriated survivors and relatives of the dead. According to Scotland Yard, the suicide bombers, whose practice shows 'terrorist methodology', had rehearsed their plan nine days earlier. Police were able to trace their movements after recovering tickets and receipts from houses connected to the bombers which indicated the route of their trip. Three years after the attacks, footage of the bombers, taken by a CCTV camera nine days before the bombings, has been shown in court as part of the trials of three suspects alleged to be involved in the preparation of the bombings. Meanwhile, five men, all British nationals, were found guilty for their part in an unsuccessful plot to carry out fertiliser bombings in the UK. As it was revealed, some of them had met with two of the London subway bombers.\",\"In September  it was announced that traffic measures had to be taken in Beijing to control the traffic jam during the Olympic Games. In August , Taipei held \\\"Human Rights Torch Relay Night\\\", in order to protest against human rights violation in China ahead of the Olympics. In September it was announced that the torch of  Olympics will not cross Taiwan due to the political disputes with China. The reciprocal consensus' between China and Taiwan became cracked in many sporting events. On April ,  the Olympic torch arrived in London. However around  people protested against the human rights issues in China and Tibet. During the route, protesters tried to extinguish the torch. The security measures were strongly and around  arrests have been made. On April ,  the torch arrived in Paris, where there were large protests and the torch went out three times. China disapproved the actions by the protesters. On April , the Olympic torch arrived to San Francisco. As protesters filled the streets the organizers changed the route of the torch and the authorities made arrests. On August , ,  spectators witnessed the Opening Ceremony of the  Olympic Games at the National Stadium in Beijing. On August ,  officials admitted part of Olympics opening ceremony was fake, specifically the young singer\\u0091s voice and some of the fireworks shown on television.

It was extremely important because the participants should be agreed for a regulatory agreement on greenhouse gas emissions for , given the fact the Kyoto Protocol expires in . At the beginning of the conference, discussions focused on the developed countries commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years. The EU suggested rapid reduce, but environmentalists were pessimist. Then, delegates from about  countries were negotiating a plan for private companies and wealthy nations to pay poorer nations to keep their forest intact. It is called the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries, or REDD proposal. Al Gore expressed the view that the US and China had to make more efforts, in order to protect the environment against global warming. Also Ban Ki-Moon said that countries must find a common ground on climate protection. After almost two weeks of negotiations, the EU threatened, pushing the US, it would not participate in another meeting, if a substantial agreement did not take place in Bali. After the US agreed to the changes proposed by India, the so called Bali Roadmap had been agreed on, to applause from all parties. The Roadmap established the target year of  and the scope for a post- climate change agreement.
